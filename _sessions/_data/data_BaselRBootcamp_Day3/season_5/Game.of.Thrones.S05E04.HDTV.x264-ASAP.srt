1
00:00:01,776 --> 00:00:04,494
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,531
<i>She was my sister.</i>

3
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:08,266
This is where she belongs.

4
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:10,976
The Boltons
have Winterfell.

5
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:14,086
You'll be marrying
his son and heir Ramsay.

6
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:15,631
You loved your family.

7
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:17,246
Avenge them.

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,413
Does your mother
like it here?

9
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:21,841
It's so wonderful to have
her watching over you.

10
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:23,936
But you'll always be
her baby boy.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,030
I want you
to be happy, Mother.

12
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:28,161
But wouldn't you be happier
in Casterly Rock?

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,545
Perhaps you might
consider being a bit more discreet?

14
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:34,400
Everybody knows everything
about everyone.

15
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,949
Where can I find
the High Sparrow?

16
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:39,556
The High Septon's behavior
was corrosive.

17
00:00:41,197 --> 00:00:43,189
Hypocrisy is a boil.

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,099
Lancing a boil
is never pleasant.

19
00:00:46,123 --> 00:00:47,644
You shall
be punished.

20
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,354
You'll protect one another.

21
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,726
Myrcella in Dorne

22
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,269
surrounded by people
who hate our family.

23
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:56,759
Your brother was murdered.

24
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:59,267
Oberyn was slain
during a trial by combat.

25
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:00,992
The Sand Snakes are with me.

26
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:03,714
They will avenge their
father while you sit here

27
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:05,180
doing nothing.

28
00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:06,478
I'm bringing
our daughter home.

29
00:01:06,502 --> 00:01:08,807
A one-handed man alone?

30
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:10,831
I never said I was going alone.

31
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:16,335
Conquerors always meet
with resistance.

32
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,759
Sons of the Harpy.

33
00:01:17,783 --> 00:01:20,003
they want to put a collar back
on all of our necks.

34
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:21,700
All they understand is blood.

35
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:24,274
Volantis is a large city.

36
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:27,731
The likelihood of you being spotted here
increases a hundredfold.

37
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:30,963
I'm taking you
to the queen.

Tarth, Ser Jaime.

45
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:53,410
The Sapphire Isle.

46
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,283
Why are we on
a merchant ship?

47
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:01,085
Why no Lannister sails?

48
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:05,723
This ship's sailing
to Oldtown.

49
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:08,392
We'll get off earlier
not far from Sunspear,

50
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:10,895
row ourselves
to the Dornish shore in the night.

51
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:13,931
You ever been to Dorne?

52
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,900
- No.
- I have.

53
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,668
The Dornish are crazy.

54
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:20,738
All they want to do
is fight and fuck, fuck and fight.

55
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:22,740
You should be happy
to go back.

56
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:25,643
There's nothing
like a good fight

57
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:27,978
to get you in the mood
for fucking.

58
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:30,247
And there's nothing like
a fuck-mad Dornish girl

59
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:32,449
to clear your head
for the next fight.

60
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:34,685
It's how the two
work together.

61
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:36,854
Now we're gonna be doing
a lot of fighting, I'm sure.

62
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:38,455
Well, I am.

63
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,225
But I don't imagine
we'll get to stick around for the rest.

64
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,294
Not after we've kidnapped
their princess.

65
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:45,329
We're not kidnapping
their princess.

66
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:48,432
We're rescuing my niece,
bringing her back to her family.

67
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:49,700
Your niece?

68
00:05:57,843 --> 00:06:00,177
I've been doing
this sort of thing a long time.

69
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,213
- I'm good at it.
- That's why you're here.

70
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:04,515
I know.
Why are you here?

71
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:06,750
Why not send 40 of me?
Or an army?

72
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:09,320
Unlike most folks,
you've actually got one.

73
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:12,189
Because I don't want
to start a war.

74
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:15,559
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

75
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:19,730
It has to be me.

76
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:25,669
If I'm putting
something like this together,

77
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:27,705
a one-handed man
who happens to be

78
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:30,441
one of the most recognizable
faces in Westeros is not--

79
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,343
It has to be me.

80
00:06:37,415 --> 00:06:39,383
You set your brother
free, didn't you?

81
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,754
I'll bet your sister
didn't like that.

82
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,758
Varys set him free.

83
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:56,734
Well, if you ever see
the wee fucker,

84
00:06:56,768 --> 00:06:58,402
give him my regards.

85
00:07:02,374 --> 00:07:04,508
He murdered my father.

86
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:10,214
If I ever see him,
I'll split him in two.

87
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,684
And then I'll give
him your regards.

88
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:24,495
The Iron Bank has called
in one-tenth of the crown's debts.

89
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:27,298
Given the expense
of rebuilding the royal fleet--

90
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:28,632
How much can
the crown afford?

91
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,234
<i>With winter coming,</i>

92
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:33,671
half what they ask,
less?

93
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:36,974
You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

94
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:39,043
House Tyrell could
front the gold

95
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:41,145
and the crown would
pay us back in time

96
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:43,881
or I'd have words
with my daughter.

97
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:51,722
You've already
given us too much.

98
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:55,693
No, we must arrange
better terms with the Iron Bank.

99
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:58,362
- Absolutely.
- In person.

100
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:03,033
- Me?
- We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank,

101
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:06,670
someone of importance
to show these bankers our respect.

102
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:09,707
As the king's Master of Coin,
I can think of no one more qualified.

103
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:11,809
I would be honored,
Your Grace.

104
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:15,779
The king's expressed concern about
his father-in-law's safety on this voyage.

105
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:23,354
He's ordered Ser Meryn
to personally lead your escort.

106
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:27,124
My very own
Kingsguard?

107
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:29,193
- Please express my--
- Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

108
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,195
Of course.
Of course.

109
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:35,099
I'll give your regards
to the Titan of Braavos.

110
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:47,244
The small council grows
smaller and smaller.

111
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:49,613
Not small enough.

112
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,860
May I offer you some wine,
Your Holiness?

113
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:04,828
No.

114
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:10,901
The old High Septon
would have asked the vintage.

115
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:13,971
I could say that our minds
are temples to the Seven

116
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:16,540
and should be kept pure.

117
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:19,777
But the truth is
I don't like the taste.

118
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:21,945
Hmm.

119
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,381
How may I serve?

120
00:09:25,784 --> 00:09:29,219
All over Westeros
we hear of septs being burned,

121
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:32,423
Silent Sisters raped,

122
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:35,059
bodies of holy men
piled in the streets.

123
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:38,629
Wars teach people
to obey the sword, not the gods.

124
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:41,632
Perhaps the gods
need a sword of their own.

125
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,634
<i>In the days before</i>
<i>the Targaryens,</i>

126
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:47,037
the Faith Militant
dispensed the justice of the Seven.

127
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:51,575
Well, the Faith Militant was
disarmed more than two centuries ago.

128
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:55,145
If I explain their holy purpose
to my son the king,

129
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,314
I have no doubt
he will sign a decree

130
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,483
arming the believers
you felt worthy.

131
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:04,088
An army that defends
the bodies and souls of the common people?

132
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:07,091
An army in service
to the gods themselves.

133
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,093
And to you, of course,

134
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:11,462
as the chosen
representative of the Seven.

135
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,098
An honor I never expected.

136
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:15,966
Or, indeed,
ever wished for.

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,768
Which is why
you were chosen.

138
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:22,172
You and I both know
how the world works.

139
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:24,408
Too often the wicked
are the wealthiest,

140
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:26,243
beyond the reach
of justice.

141
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:30,013
The king himself cannot always
punish those who deserve it most.

142
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:33,217
All sinners are equal
before the gods.

143
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:41,859
What would you say if I told you
of a great sinner in our very midst?

144
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:44,828
Shielded by gold
and privilege.

145
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:49,466
May the Father
judge him justly.

146
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:24,401
What are you doing?

147
00:11:27,906 --> 00:11:30,274
Help me!
Help me!

148
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:39,516
Yeah. Yeah.

149
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:42,052
Get off me!

150
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:50,694
Come on.

151
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:53,230
Shut up!
Move!

152
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:02,806
This is Lord Petyr Baelish's
establishment.

153
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:16,954
<i>Cocksuckers.</i>

154
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:19,356
<i>Boy fucker.</i>

155
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:22,359
<i>You buggering filth!</i>

156
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:25,796
There's a special place
in the seventh hell for your kind.

157
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,498
Please.
Please, I'll pay.

158
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:30,567
I'll-- I'll pay
all of you.

159
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:32,736
Yes, you will.

160
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:09,706
Seize him.

161
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:11,375
Sinner.

162
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:12,643
Get your hands off me.

163
00:13:12,677 --> 00:13:14,211
Ser Loras
of House Tyrell,

164
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:16,346
you have broken the laws
of gods and men.

165
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:19,149
Who do you
think you are?

166
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:22,019
Justice.

167
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:30,794
Why is my brother
in a cell?

168
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:33,363
I-I don't know.

169
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:35,132
I-I didn't order it.

170
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,401
We both know who did.

171
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:41,505
You told me she was returning
to Casterly Rock.

172
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:43,874
Are you saying
my mother's behind this?

173
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:46,376
She's jealous
you're not hers anymore.

174
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:49,279
<i>Arresting my brother</i>
<i>is her revenge.</i>

175
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:51,415
Aren't you and Mother
getting along?

176
00:13:57,088 --> 00:14:00,891
Oh, my sweet,
sweet king.

177
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:05,696
Do you have any affection
for me at all?

178
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:09,232
Of course I do.

179
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,134
You're my queen.

180
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:13,537
I can't bear
to think of my brother

181
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:16,340
locked away
in some grimy cell.

182
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:20,744
I'll set him free
for you.

183
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,346
Do you promise?

184
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:31,755
I demand that
Ser Loras be freed now.

185
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,690
Did I arrest him?

186
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:37,461
Well, no.

187
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:39,863
But y-you armed
the Faith Militant.

188
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:43,433
You gave the High Sparrow
an army.

189
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:45,736
I did.

190
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,840
And your wife has
every right to criticize.

191
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:52,576
We can't allow fanatics
to arrest the queen's brother

192
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,212
no matter his perversions.

193
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:57,080
Then...

194
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,184
can I tell Margaery
you'll have Ser Loras released?

195
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:03,887
I told you,
I'm not holding Ser Loras.

196
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:05,889
You're the king.

197
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:07,657
I'm sure if you speak
to the High Sparrow,

198
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:10,227
he'll release
the poor boy.

199
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:17,000
Halt!

200
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,959
His Holiness is praying.
He will not be disturbed.

201
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:47,831
Give the order
and we'll clear out this rabble.

202
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:52,102
You mean, kill them?

203
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:53,937
Here at the Sept?

204
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:56,106
You'd be sending them
to meet the gods that they love.

205
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:02,212
<i>Bastard!</i>

206
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:04,448
<i>You're an abomination!</i>

207
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,755
<i>Born of sin!</i>

208
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:14,024
<i>Filthy bastard!</i>

209
00:16:18,763 --> 00:16:20,964
We'll find another way.

210
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,734
<i>Abomination!</i>

211
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:32,442
My queen?

212
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:39,950
There was no way
to free Ser Loras without violence.

213
00:16:43,187 --> 00:16:45,622
You're the King
of the Andals,

214
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:47,324
the Lord
of the Seven Kingdoms,

215
00:16:47,358 --> 00:16:49,559
<i>the Protector</i>
<i>of the Realm,</i>

216
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:52,929
<i>and you let a band</i>
<i>of fanatics imprison your brother by law.</i>

217
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:55,966
I'm going to speak
with the High Sparrow.

218
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,034
Are you?
When?

219
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,005
- I-I don't know.
- You don't know?

220
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,574
He was praying
just now.

221
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:09,513
I have to send word
to Grandmother.

222
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:12,849
Will you
come back later?

223
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:17,187
I need to be with
my family, Your Grace.

224
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:20,257
Of course.

225
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,828
You think highly
of this boy?

226
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:26,363
Good.

227
00:17:26,397 --> 00:17:28,365
Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

228
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:31,134
And a bastard
by some tavern slut.

229
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:34,237
Perhaps, but that wasn't
Ned Stark's way.

230
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:40,010
I should have
given you a son.

231
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:43,313
Not your fault.

232
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:45,282
Whose, then?

233
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:47,817
I gave you nothing
but weakness.

234
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:52,255
And deformity.

235
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:56,226
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

236
00:17:56,294 --> 00:17:58,228
My lady.

237
00:17:58,262 --> 00:18:01,031
Her father is the Lord's
chosen king,

238
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:03,767
and her father's blood
runs through her veins.

239
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,078
You march on
Winterfell soon?

240
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:18,481
We must
to beat the snows.

241
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:22,085
Once before, you put
your faith in Ser Davos

242
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,254
and left me behind.

243
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:28,758
I hope you won't make
that mistake again.

244
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:30,493
I won't.

245
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,531
I need you.

246
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:37,200
You only need faith,
my king.

247
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:43,740
And you, my lady,
what do you need?

248
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:48,278
To serve my Lord.

249
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:54,618
Lord Ashford.

250
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:02,092
Lady Caulfield.

251
00:19:03,294 --> 00:19:06,296
Oh, Lord Smallwood.

252
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,164
I've never even heard
of these people.

253
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:10,767
They haven't heard
of you, either.

254
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:13,203
But we need men
and they have some.

255
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:18,308
How many men does this
Lord Mayzen have to send us?

256
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:20,744
More than Lord Wibberley.

257
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:36,459
- Not him.
- <i>I know, I'm sorry.</i>

258
00:19:36,494 --> 00:19:38,828
But we need men
and supplies

259
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:40,363
and Roose Bolton's
the Warden of the North.

260
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:41,765
He murdered my brother.

261
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:45,068
We swore to be
the watchers on the Wall.

262
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:48,571
We can't watch the Wall
with 50 men.

263
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:50,373
And we can't get more men

264
00:19:50,408 --> 00:19:52,709
without help from
the Warden of the North.

265
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:17,801
Apologies, my lady.

266
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:31,381
Lord Commander.

267
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,783
How can I help you?

268
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:36,086
<i>Come with us</i>
<i>when we ride south.</i>

269
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,389
None of us know the castle
as well as you do.

270
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:41,858
Its hidden tunnels,
its weaknesses,

271
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:44,527
its people.

272
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:46,863
Winterfell
was your home once.

273
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,867
Don't you want
to chase the rats out of it?

274
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,905
Castle Black
is my home now.

275
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,542
<i>The Night's Watch take no part</i>
<i>in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.</i>

276
00:20:59,577 --> 00:21:01,611
There's only one war.

277
00:21:01,645 --> 00:21:03,913
Life against death.

278
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:09,085
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

279
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,721
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

280
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:15,225
Forgive me, my lady,
I don't trust in visions.

281
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:20,096
No visions.
No magic.

282
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:22,165
Just life.

283
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:44,587
Do you feel
my heart beating?

284
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:48,858
There's power in you.

285
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:51,795
You resist it,
and that's your mistake.

286
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:53,696
Embrace it.

287
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:07,544
The Lord of Light
made us male and female.

288
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:10,213
Two parts
of a greater whole.

289
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:14,951
In our joining,
there's power.

290
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,487
Power to make life,

291
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:19,856
power to make light,

292
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:22,759
and power
to cast shadows.

293
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:25,862
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

294
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:29,165
Then we shouldn't
tell him.

295
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:32,702
- I can't.
- Why?

296
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:36,039
I swore a vow.

297
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:39,642
I loved another.

298
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:41,945
The dead
don't need lovers.

299
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:44,247
Only the living.

300
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,521
I know.

301
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:53,623
But I still love her.

302
00:23:08,272 --> 00:23:10,707
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

303
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:49,512
Are you lonely?

304
00:23:51,048 --> 00:23:52,548
Just bored.

305
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,217
My father used
to tell me that boredom

306
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:55,885
indicates a lack
of inner resources.

307
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,553
Were you bored
a lot, too?

308
00:23:57,588 --> 00:24:00,156
I know
Castle Black

309
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,591
is no place
for a child, but--

310
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:05,228
I like it.
I thought I'd be left at home.

311
00:24:05,262 --> 00:24:07,897
I know Mother
didn't want to bring me.

312
00:24:07,932 --> 00:24:09,999
Why do you say that?

313
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,770
She told me,
"I don't want to bring you."

314
00:24:15,472 --> 00:24:17,340
She shouldn't
have said that.

315
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,385
Are you ashamed
of me, Father?

316
00:24:40,631 --> 00:24:43,266
When you were an infant,

317
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,769
a Dornish trader
landed on Dragonstone.

318
00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:50,173
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

319
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:55,211
He had even sewn a dress
on it in the colors of our house.

320
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,248
No doubt he had
heard of your birth

321
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:02,485
and assumed new fathers
were easy targets.

322
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:09,392
I still remember how you smiled
when I put that doll in your cradle.

323
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:13,262
How you pressed it
to your cheek.

324
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,672
By the time we burned the doll,
it was too late.

325
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,610
I was told you would die.

326
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:30,646
Or worse,

327
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:32,548
the greyscale
would go slow.

328
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:35,718
<i>Let you grow just enough</i>
<i>to know the world</i>

329
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:37,987
<i>before taking it</i>
<i>away from you.</i>

330
00:25:38,022 --> 00:25:40,690
Everyone advised me to send
you to the ruins of Valyria

331
00:25:40,724 --> 00:25:42,792
to live out your short life
with the Stone Men

332
00:25:42,826 --> 00:25:45,828
<i>before the sickness</i>
<i>spread through the castle.</i>

333
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:49,866
I told them all
to go to hell.

334
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:54,337
<i>I called in every maester</i>
<i>on this side of the world.</i>

335
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:57,573
Every healer.
Every apothecary.

336
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:01,811
They stopped the disease
and saved your life.

337
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,847
'Cause you did not belong
across the world

338
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:07,617
with the bloody Stone Men.

339
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:10,553
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

340
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:14,991
And you are my daughter.

341
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:18,654
<i>I thought I might</i>
<i>find you here.</i>

342
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:23,126
<i>Your Aunt Lyanna.</i>

343
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,095
Father never
talked about her.

344
00:27:27,698 --> 00:27:30,666
Sometimes I'd find him
down here lighting the candles.

345
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:33,669
They say
she was beautiful.

346
00:27:33,704 --> 00:27:36,038
I saw her once.

347
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:39,175
I was a boy living
with your mother's family.

348
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:42,879
Lord Whent held
a great tourney at Harrenhal.

349
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:44,981
Everyone was there.

350
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:48,484
The Mad King,
your father,

351
00:27:48,552 --> 00:27:50,052
Robert Baratheon,

352
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,954
and Lyanna.

353
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:54,824
She was already
promised to Robert.

354
00:27:54,858 --> 00:27:56,692
You can imagine
what it was like for me,

355
00:27:56,727 --> 00:28:00,263
a boy from nowhere
with nothing to his name,

356
00:28:00,297 --> 00:28:02,064
watching these
legendary men

357
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:05,001
tilting
at the lists.

358
00:28:05,035 --> 00:28:07,904
The last two riders
were Barristan Selmy

359
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:09,972
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

360
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:13,809
When Rhaegar won,
everyone cheered for their prince.

361
00:28:13,844 --> 00:28:15,778
I remember the girls
laughing when he took off his helmet

362
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:17,813
and they saw
that silver hair.

363
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:20,216
How handsome he was.

364
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,052
Until he rode
right past his wife,

365
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,087
Elia Martell,

366
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:27,056
and all the smiles died.

367
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:30,693
I've never seen
so many people so quiet.

368
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:35,131
He rode past his wife

369
00:28:35,165 --> 00:28:39,135
and he lay a crown
of winter roses in Lyanna's lap.

370
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:41,270
Blue as frost.

371
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:46,709
How many
tens of thousands had to die

372
00:28:46,777 --> 00:28:48,778
because Rhaegar
chose your aunt?

373
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:54,083
Yes, he chose her.

374
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:56,652
And then he kidnapped her
and raped her.

375
00:29:04,595 --> 00:29:06,662
Come.

376
00:29:06,697 --> 00:29:09,131
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

377
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:15,972
You're dressed
for riding.

378
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:18,474
I am.

379
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:20,443
Where are you going?

380
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,445
King's Landing.

381
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:24,313
King's Landing?

382
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,215
Cersei sent for me.

383
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,951
We mustn't let her
sniff out any trouble.

384
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,620
You can't leave me here.

385
00:29:30,654 --> 00:29:33,222
I know how hard it is to live with
people you despise.

386
00:29:33,257 --> 00:29:34,924
Believe me.

387
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,926
But it won't be for long.

388
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,294
How do you know?

389
00:29:39,796 --> 00:29:43,032
Stannis Baratheon
garrisons at Castle Black.

390
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:45,501
He'll march south
to King's Landing

391
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:47,503
before the winter snows
block his way.

392
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:50,506
But first he has
to take Winterfell.

393
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,075
- You don't know that.
- I do.

394
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:56,445
Once he liberates
these lands from the Boltons,

395
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,981
he'll rally your father's
bannermen to his cause.

396
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:00,950
With the North behind him,

397
00:30:00,984 --> 00:30:03,486
Stannis can finally take
the Iron Throne.

398
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:06,289
You think he'll
defeat the Boltons?

399
00:30:06,323 --> 00:30:08,024
He has a larger army.

400
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:10,626
He's the finest military
commander in Westeros.

401
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:14,196
A betting man would put
his money on Stannis.

402
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:16,766
As it happens,
I am a betting man.

403
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:20,002
And if you're right?

404
00:30:20,037 --> 00:30:21,937
Stannis takes Winterfell,

405
00:30:21,972 --> 00:30:24,940
he rescues you from
the most despised family in the North.

406
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:28,311
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

407
00:30:28,345 --> 00:30:30,913
he names you
Wardeness of the North.

408
00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:33,249
But I--

409
00:30:33,283 --> 00:30:34,950
I wouldn't--

410
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:36,485
Wardeness of the North?

411
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,388
You are the last
surviving Stark.

412
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:41,157
He needs .

413
00:30:41,191 --> 00:30:42,458
And what if you're wrong?

414
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:44,193
What if Stannis never
attacks Winterfell?

415
00:30:44,227 --> 00:30:46,896
Or he does and the Boltons
defeat him?

416
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,098
Then you will take
this Bolton boy, Ramsay,

417
00:30:49,132 --> 00:30:50,866
and make him yours.

418
00:30:50,901 --> 00:30:52,735
I don't know
how to do that.

419
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,570
Of course you do.

420
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,405
He's already
fallen for you.

421
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,441
His father frightens me.

422
00:30:58,475 --> 00:31:01,944
He should.
He's a dangerous man.

423
00:31:01,978 --> 00:31:05,648
But even the most dangerous
men can be outmaneuvered.

424
00:31:05,682 --> 00:31:08,384
And you've learned
to maneuver from the very best.

425
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:13,189
I'll return
before too long.

426
00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:16,125
You'll be strong
without me.

427
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,835
The North will be yours.

428
00:31:27,204 --> 00:31:29,338
Do you believe me?

429
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:34,543
I expect I'll be a married woman
by the time you return.

430
00:32:38,308 --> 00:32:40,009
Breakfast.

431
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,881
That would have been
a shit way to die.

432
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:48,984
As far as I've seen,
they're all shit ways to die.

433
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:52,421
Aye, but your lot have
to give the singers a good ending.

434
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:55,090
I don't care what's sung about me
when I'm dead.

435
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:57,226
No?

436
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,962
Two knights off
to rescue a princess.

437
00:32:59,996 --> 00:33:01,864
Sounds like
a good song to me.

438
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:04,233
Sounds like
all the rest.

439
00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:08,871
What about you?

440
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:11,307
What shit way
would you choose?

441
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:15,611
In my own keep
drinking my own wine

442
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:17,913
watching my sons
grovel for my fortune.

443
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:21,383
How disappointing.

444
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:24,587
I thought you'd have something
more exciting planned.

445
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:26,856
I've had
an exciting life.

446
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,024
I want my death
to be boring.

447
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,595
How do you
want to go?

448
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:35,064
In the arms
of the woman I love.

449
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:40,836
She want the same thing?

450
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:47,543
Let's go.

451
00:33:57,354 --> 00:33:59,421
The captain of that ship--

452
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:00,990
what was he, Braavosi?

453
00:34:01,024 --> 00:34:02,758
Pentoshi.

454
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,393
And he's headed
to Oldtown?

455
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:06,462
As I said.
Why?

456
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:09,298
What's to stop him from
docking down the coast

457
00:34:09,332 --> 00:34:11,967
and telling the locals
that Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?

458
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:13,969
A bag of gold.

459
00:34:14,004 --> 00:34:15,804
I'm not sure
you understand

460
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,374
how much people hate
your family in this part of the world.

461
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:20,175
It was a heavy bag.

462
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,245
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

463
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,114
But you won't be around
if he breaks 'em.

464
00:34:35,025 --> 00:34:36,559
<i>How many you count?</i>

465
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:37,960
Four.

466
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:39,662
How many do you think
you can take?

467
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,830
One if he's slow.

468
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:47,236
Halt!

469
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,371
Over the hill.

470
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:53,242
Fucked in the ass.

471
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,981
Hyah!

472
00:35:02,886 --> 00:35:05,220
Morning, lads.

473
00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:07,289
Glad we found you.

474
00:35:07,324 --> 00:35:08,757
Who are you?

475
00:35:08,825 --> 00:35:10,759
Cooper.

476
00:35:10,794 --> 00:35:13,095
This is Darnell.

477
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:14,496
You're from
King's Landing.

478
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:16,332
Accent gave me away?

479
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,902
Flea Bottom,
whelped and whipped.

480
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,670
Why are you here?

481
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:23,472
Our ship capsized
in the night.

482
00:35:23,506 --> 00:35:24,807
We managed
to swim ashore.

483
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:27,676
It was a near
thing, really.

484
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:30,145
Thought the sharks
would get us.

485
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,248
There are no sharks
in Dorne.

486
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:37,753
Could have sworn
those were shark fins.

487
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:39,688
Dolphins, maybe.

488
00:35:41,257 --> 00:35:42,825
Throw your swords
in the sand.

489
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:45,628
Boys, there's
no need for this.

490
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:48,130
Just point us
in the right direction,

491
00:35:48,164 --> 00:35:49,898
we'll find our way home.

492
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:52,368
Swords in the sand now.

493
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,523
Hyah! Hyah!

494
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,897
That one should
be slow enough.

495
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:17,586
<i>Nice move.</i>

496
00:37:18,855 --> 00:37:20,956
Luck.

497
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,158
You had
a wonderful teacher.

498
00:37:36,473 --> 00:37:39,875
Always wanted
a Dornish stallion.

499
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:43,245
Beasts can run
a day and night without tiring.

500
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:45,114
We'll ride
to the Water Gardens

501
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:46,849
with a nice breeze
in our faces.

502
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:48,484
First we need
to bury these bodies.

503
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:50,886
Birds have
to eat, too.

504
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,355
Corpses raise questions.
Questions raise armies.

505
00:37:53,389 --> 00:37:55,791
We're not here
to start a war.

506
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:58,594
Do you know how long
it'll take us to dig all those holes?

507
00:37:58,628 --> 00:38:01,797
I can't dig very well
with one hand.

508
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:03,732
Not at all, really.

509
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:35,831
Mama.

510
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:43,672
Nym, Obara.

511
00:38:43,706 --> 00:38:45,808
Will it be war?

512
00:38:45,842 --> 00:38:48,377
Prince Doran will weep
for your father, but nothing else.

513
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,712
We must avenge
Oberyn ourselves.

514
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:54,049
Without Doran, we have no
army to march against the Lannisters.

515
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,819
We don't need an army
to start a war.

516
00:38:56,886 --> 00:39:00,622
<i>Queen Cersei loves</i>
<i>her children.</i>

517
00:39:00,657 --> 00:39:02,591
And we have one of them.

518
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,626
You may have a problem.

519
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:13,135
A ship's captain
who found me in Planky Town

520
00:39:13,169 --> 00:39:14,803
claiming he had
information to sell.

521
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:18,807
He told me he smuggled
Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

522
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:22,244
He's come for Myrcella.

523
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,980
If he gets to her
before we do,

524
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:27,950
we lose our only chance
for revenge.

525
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:31,320
You must choose.

526
00:39:31,354 --> 00:39:33,222
Doran's way and peace,

527
00:39:33,256 --> 00:39:36,091
or my way and war.

528
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:41,830
I'm with you always.

529
00:39:41,865 --> 00:39:43,398
Nym?

530
00:39:47,503 --> 00:39:49,805
Obara?

531
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,709
When I was a child,
Oberyn came to take me to court.

532
00:39:53,743 --> 00:39:55,477
I had never seen
this man,

533
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:58,046
and yet he called
himself my father.

534
00:39:58,081 --> 00:39:59,548
My mother wept,

535
00:39:59,582 --> 00:40:02,851
said I was too young
and a girl.

536
00:40:05,355 --> 00:40:08,257
Oberyn tossed his spear
at my feet and said,

537
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:11,260
"Girl or boy,
we fight our battles,

538
00:40:11,294 --> 00:40:14,496
but the gods let us
choose our weapons."

539
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,266
My father pointed
to the spear

540
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,334
and then
to my mother's tears.

541
00:40:26,976 --> 00:40:29,278
I made my choice
long ago.

542
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:34,516
Will you untie me?

543
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,552
<i>Will you please untie me?</i>

544
00:40:37,587 --> 00:40:39,821
Will you please?

545
00:41:02,745 --> 00:41:04,513
Thank you.

546
00:41:12,655 --> 00:41:14,489
Who are you?

547
00:41:14,524 --> 00:41:15,924
Your captor.

548
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:19,828
Do you have wine?

549
00:41:19,862 --> 00:41:21,897
<i>No.</i>

550
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:23,799
Can't sleep
without wine.

551
00:41:23,866 --> 00:41:26,001
Then stay awake.

552
00:41:31,507 --> 00:41:33,241
You're going
the wrong way.

553
00:41:34,711 --> 00:41:37,112
My sister
is in Westeros.

554
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:39,982
Westeros is west.

555
00:41:40,016 --> 00:41:41,516
We're heading east.

556
00:41:41,551 --> 00:41:43,952
<i>I'm not taking you</i>
<i>to your sister.</i>

557
00:41:45,521 --> 00:41:47,756
You said you were
taking me to the queen.

558
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:51,026
I am.
Queen Daenerys Targaryen.

559
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,794
She's the queen I serve.

560
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:02,738
What a waste
of a good kidnapping.

561
00:42:02,772 --> 00:42:05,240
It so happens
I was heading there myself.

562
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:07,409
What business would you
have with the queen?

563
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:11,013
Gold and glory.
Oh, and hate.

564
00:42:11,047 --> 00:42:13,782
If you'd ever met my sister,
you'd understand.

565
00:42:15,251 --> 00:42:18,553
So, now that it's clear
we are on the same side...

566
00:42:28,231 --> 00:42:31,600
<i>A highborn knight</i>
<i>from the North of Westeros</i>

567
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:34,136
down on his luck
in Essos.

568
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:38,173
Dragon epaulets,
bear Sigil breastplate.

569
00:42:39,575 --> 00:42:41,610
You're Jorah Mormont.

570
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:44,379
<i>I have to ask.</i>

571
00:42:44,414 --> 00:42:46,615
How exactly were you
serving your queen

572
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:49,451
in a whorehouse
half a world away?

573
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:52,087
Is it possible
that you were running?

574
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:54,689
Why would you be running?

575
00:42:54,724 --> 00:42:56,925
And why would she
have sent you away?

576
00:42:56,959 --> 00:43:00,195
Oh, wait.

577
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:03,432
You were spying
on her, weren't you?

578
00:43:03,466 --> 00:43:05,100
<i>It's all coming</i>
<i>back to me.</i>

579
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:07,569
I was drunk through
most of the small council meetings,

580
00:43:07,603 --> 00:43:09,337
but it's all coming back.

581
00:43:09,405 --> 00:43:13,208
You passed notes
to Varys's little birds.

582
00:43:13,242 --> 00:43:16,478
<i>She found out,</i>
<i>didn't she?</i>

583
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:19,948
<i>Found out and exiled you.</i>

584
00:43:19,982 --> 00:43:24,719
Now you hope to win back
her favor with a gift.

585
00:43:24,754 --> 00:43:26,922
Risky scheme.

586
00:43:26,956 --> 00:43:29,658
<i>One might</i>
<i>even say desperate.</i>

587
00:43:31,194 --> 00:43:34,596
You think Daenerys
will execute me and pardon you?

588
00:43:36,065 --> 00:43:38,366
I'd say the reverse
is just as likely.

589
00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:02,491
Everyone looks happy
enough from up here.

590
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,261
What?

591
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:08,196
I was thinking about
all the times your brother

592
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:10,332
made me go with him
down from the Red Keep

593
00:44:10,366 --> 00:44:12,100
into the streets
of King's Landing.

594
00:44:12,135 --> 00:44:14,836
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people.

595
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:17,105
He liked to sing to them.

596
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,673
He sang to them?

597
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:20,675
Yes.

598
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,011
Rhaegar would pick
a spot on the Hook

599
00:44:23,045 --> 00:44:26,148
or the Street of Seeds
and then he'd sing.

600
00:44:26,182 --> 00:44:27,782
Just like all
the other minstrels.

601
00:44:27,817 --> 00:44:28,984
And what did you do?

602
00:44:29,018 --> 00:44:30,619
I made sure
no one killed him.

603
00:44:30,653 --> 00:44:33,655
And I collected
the money.

604
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:36,057
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

605
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:38,260
- He was good?
- He was very good.

606
00:44:38,294 --> 00:44:39,928
Viserys never told you?

607
00:44:39,962 --> 00:44:43,064
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

608
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:44,766
Rhaegar never
liked killing.

609
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,901
He loved singing.

610
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:48,003
And what did you do
with the money?

611
00:44:48,037 --> 00:44:51,239
Well, one time, he gave it to the next
minstrel down the street.

612
00:44:51,274 --> 00:44:53,942
One time, he gave it
to an orphanage in Flea Bottom.

613
00:44:53,976 --> 00:44:57,746
One time, we got
horribly drunk.

614
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:01,783
Your Grace.

615
00:45:01,817 --> 00:45:05,420
Hizdahr is here, waiting
in the audience chamber.

616
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:07,289
How many others
are there?

617
00:45:07,323 --> 00:45:10,325
50? 100?

618
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:12,327
Will you be joining us,
Ser Barristan?

619
00:45:12,395 --> 00:45:16,164
I think I can protect you
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

620
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:18,700
I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

621
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:21,303
Go, Ser Barristan.

622
00:45:21,337 --> 00:45:22,737
Sing a song for me.

623
00:45:22,772 --> 00:45:25,207
Your Grace.

624
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,548
All men must die,
but not all can die in glory.

625
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:35,684
- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

626
00:45:35,718 --> 00:45:37,953
Why did your ancestors
cross the Narrow Sea

627
00:45:37,987 --> 00:45:39,454
and conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

628
00:45:39,488 --> 00:45:42,023
So their names
would live on.

629
00:45:42,058 --> 00:45:43,692
Those who find victory
in the fighting pits

630
00:45:43,726 --> 00:45:47,028
will never become kings,
but their names will live on.

631
00:45:47,063 --> 00:45:48,964
It's the best chance
they'll ever have.

632
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:50,565
Is that what
you used to tell men

633
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,468
before you set them
to butchering each other for sport?

634
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:56,271
Your Grace, today is the traditional start
of the fighting season.

635
00:45:56,305 --> 00:45:58,240
I do not recognize
this tradition.

636
00:45:58,274 --> 00:46:01,376
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city,

637
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,111
