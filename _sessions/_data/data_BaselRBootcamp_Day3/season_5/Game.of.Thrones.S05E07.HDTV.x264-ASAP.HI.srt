1
00:00:02,652 --> 00:00:04,317
Did you kill Joffrey?

2
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:07,677
That was something
my new friends wanted very badly.

3
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:10,644
You don't think I'd let you
marry that beast, do you?

4
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:13,831
We engaged
in intimate relations.

5
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:16,042
<i>Queen Margaery walked in on us.</i>

6
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:17,687
There is enough evidence

7
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:19,103
to bring a formal trial

8
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:20,103
<i>for Ser Loras</i>

9
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:21,286
and Queen Margaery.

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,317
Take her.

11
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:23,700
Lancel Lannister.

12
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,036
Brother Lancel.

13
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,484
We abandon
our family names.

14
00:00:26,508 --> 00:00:27,951
Quite a family
to abandon.

15
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:31,422
To forge a lasting bond with
the people,

16
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:33,813
I will marry the leader
of an ancient family.

17
00:00:33,837 --> 00:00:35,348
And reopen
the fighting pits.

18
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,713
That's a slave ship

19
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:41,346
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,168
I'll prove my worth.

21
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:45,008
I want you
to be my wife.

22
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:46,672
We have to go,
Myrcella, now.

23
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:49,588

24
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:51,116

25
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:53,140
Drop your weapons!

26
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:57,638
We're going
to have a baby.

27
00:00:57,662 --> 00:00:58,877
From the way
she's carrying,

28
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:00,330
it looks like a boy.

29
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:03,009
Maybe Lady Sansa's
better off here.

30
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:05,258
Sansa's in danger even
if she doesn't realize it.

31
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,706
If you're ever
in trouble,

32
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,146
light a candle in the highest window
of the broken tower.

33
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:13,522
Will you take this man?

34
00:01:14,237 --> 00:01:15,546
I take this man.

35
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,715
You've known Sansa
since she was a girl.

36
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:19,590
Now watch her
become a woman.

37
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:21,614
<i>( clothes ripping )</i>

I shall mount
Roose Bolton's head on a spike.

41
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,779
The queen

42
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:29,830
They're coming with us.

43

We march at sunrise.

44
00:01:31,764 --> 00:01:33,277
I'd have you go
north of the Wall.

45
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,925
Gather the remaining
free folk wherever

46
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:36,849
they are and bring them back here.

47

I'll open the gates
for them and let them through.

48

Make peace to save

First Ranger, you have
command of Castle Black.

59
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:48,860
Lord Commander,
it is my duty to tell you

60
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:52,163
I believe this mission
to be reckless, foolhardy,

61

and an insult
to all the brothers

As always, thank you
for your honesty.

00:05:06,912 --> 00:05:08,646
Safe travels,
Lord Commander.

65
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,982
Thank you, Sam.

Oh, um...

It's dragonglass.

68
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:22,226
It's what I used
to kill the white walker.

69
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:29,567
I hope
you don't need them.

70
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:31,736
Me, too.

71
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:48,252

<i>One of the first things</i>

His little brother Aegon.
He became king.

81
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:34,031
And before that,
he was a jolly fellow,

Do what he says
or he'll hurt you.

He already hurts me
every night.

All day I'm locked
in this room

98

and every night
he comes...

It can't be any worse.

100
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,593
It can.
It can always be worse.

- What did he do to you?
- Please.

102
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:22,139
- You betrayed my family!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

103
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:24,408
You have to help me.
Theon, help me.

104
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:27,778
He'll see us.
You don't know him.

105
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:29,413
My family still has
friends in the North.

106

All I need to do is give a signal
and they'll rescue me.

Sam: <i>His name</i>

At the Wall,
a dozen lord commanders

came and went during
his years of service,

but he was always there
to counsel them.

He was the blood

but now his fire

Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon

He's a respected

His troops are loyal

He's hired thousands
of foreign sellswords to bolster his army.

But this storm is a stroke of luck
for us northerners.

162

Our people are used
to fighting in the frost.

00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:20,764
His army is out there now
suffering in the snow.

164
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,001
One day I'll be
Lord of Winterfell

165
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:26,270
and Warden of the North.

166
00:14:26,304 --> 00:14:28,639
You'll be my lady
and Wardeness.

167
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:33,944
But isn't
your stepmother pregnant?

168
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:36,747
What of it?

169
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:38,849
What happens
if she has a boy?

170
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:42,086
Then I'll have
a baby brother.

171
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,654
But he'll be the heir.

172
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:45,990
I'm Lord Bolton's
eldest son.

173
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:47,424
But you're a bastard.

174
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,394
A trueborn will always
have the stronger claim.

175
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:55,933
I've been naturalized
by a royal decree from--

176
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:59,236
Tommen Baratheon?
Another bastard.

177
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:09,079
Bastards can rise
high in the world.

178
00:15:09,114 --> 00:15:12,216
Like your half-brother
Jon Snow.

179
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:16,153
Born the bastard
of Winterfell,

180
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:19,189
now the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

181
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,427
You didn't know?

182
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:26,463
Yes, he's done
very well for himself.

183
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:28,165
Oh.

184
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,001
I nearly forgot why
I asked you to join me.

185
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:32,703
Come, my lady.

186
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:45,916
Ramsay:
<i>Your northern friend.</i>

187
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:51,655
Reek told me
you wanted to leave.

188
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,257
Why?

189
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,692
Winterfell is your home

190
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:57,361
and I am your husband.

191
00:15:57,395 --> 00:15:59,329
<i>Tough old bird.</i>

192
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:01,799
Everyone talks
when I start peeling them.

193
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,134
<i>But this one,</i>

194
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:06,970
her heart gave out
before I even got to her face.

195
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,309
We do breed them tough
in the North.

196
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:21,018
Bring my wife
back to her chamber.

197
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:23,487
It's far too cold
out here for a lady.

198
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:26,523
You should hold on
to your candles.

199
00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:29,727
<i>The nights</i>
<i>are so long now.</i>

200
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:48,011
( chuckles )

201
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:52,216
( chatter )

202
00:16:55,954 --> 00:16:57,988
- ( chatter continues )
- ( man coughing )

203
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,845
Davos: <i>40 horses died</i>
<i>in the night.</i>

204
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,615
We'll lose more
come sunset.

205
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:26,116
We're running
out of food.

206
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:29,052
We can't open the supply line
until the snow clears.

207
00:17:34,225 --> 00:17:35,292
What else?

208
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:38,495
The Stormcrows
rode off last night.

209
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:43,433
500 men.

210
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:48,739
Sellswords.

211
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:51,208
Loyal to nothing
but gold.

212
00:17:54,712 --> 00:17:57,281
We still have a hard march
to Winterfell

213
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:58,982
and we won't be marching
anywhere in this weather.

214
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:00,617
And?

215
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:02,252
This isn't our time.

216
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:05,756
We should head back to Castle Black
when the snow clears.

217
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,225
I retreated from
King's Landing, Ser Davos.

218
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:11,728
If I retreat again,
I'll become the King Who Ran.

219
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,831
- Your Grace--
- Winter is coming.

220
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:16,934
Those aren't just the Stark words.
It's a fact.

221
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:19,870
If we march
back to Castle Black,

222
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:22,105
we winter at Castle Black.

223
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,308
And who can say
how many years

224
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,009
this winter will last?

225
00:18:26,044 --> 00:18:28,212
It's better to wait for the right time
than risk everything.

226
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:30,480
This is the right time
and I will risk everything.

227
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:33,717
Because if I don't,
we've lost.

228
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:35,886
We march to victory

229
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,790
or we march to defeat.

230
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:42,392
But we go forward.
Only forward.

231
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,137
Your Grace.

232
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,311
I've trusted
in your visions

233
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:04,381
and your prophecies
for years.

234
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:07,017
You saw it yourself,
my king,

235
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:08,919
when you stared
into the flames.

236
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:10,420
<i>A great battle</i>
<i>in the snow.</i>

237
00:19:10,455 --> 00:19:12,689
- I don't know what I saw.
- <i>You do know.</i>

238
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:13,924
Trust yourself.

239
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,193
And you?
Do you trust yourself?

240
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:18,528
I trust in the Lord.

241
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:23,367
Are you sure?

242
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,376
I have seen myself walk along
the battlements of Winterfell.

243
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:37,381
I have seen the flayed man banners
lowered to the ground.

244
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,760
But sometimes sacrifices must be made
to ensure victory.

245
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:54,965
I have shown you
the power of king's blood.

246
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:56,433
The usurper Robb Stark.

247
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:58,835
The usurper
Joffrey Baratheon.

248
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,305
We don't have
Robert's bastard here.

249
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:04,942
No, we have
someone better.

250
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,845
And your blood
runs through her veins.

251
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,349
Have you lost your mind?

252
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:14,051
Do you doubt me?

253
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:16,520
Still?

254
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:18,155
After all
that you've seen.

255
00:20:18,189 --> 00:20:20,023
There must be
another way.

256
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:22,659
- Leeches or--
- There is only one way.

257
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:26,530
You must become king
before the Long Night begins.

258
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:28,765
On you can lead
the living against the dead.

259
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,069
All your life has led us
to this moment.

260
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:34,538
- To this decision.
- She's my daughter.

261
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:39,109
Get out.

262
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,864
<i>( door opens )</i>

263
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:02,733
There's always
some sort of grub on.

264
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:04,968
A bit of mutton
would be nice.

265
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:12,309
- A beauty from beyond the Wall.
- <i>( man chuckles )</i>

266
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:14,845
Where you going, love?
Aren't we better-looking than the fat man?

267
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,081
No, the question is she pretty
down south in the real world

268
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:20,083
or is she pretty
'cause she's the only girl here?

269
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:21,918
Even in White Harbor,
I'd want a kiss.

270
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,855
Come on, love,
give us a kiss.

271
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:25,631
Leave me alone.

272
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:27,695
Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

273
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,626
- One little kiss.
- Come on, give him a kiss.

274
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,995
A man gets lonely
guarding the Wall.

275
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:37,868
There's no need
to be rude.

276
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:40,037
We just want
a little affection.

277
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:42,539
Ooh.
( laughs )

278
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,876
Get your hands off her.

279
00:21:45,943 --> 00:21:48,779
Brother Derek,
Brother Brant,

280
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:50,714
I believe you both
have guard duty tonight.

281
00:21:50,782 --> 00:21:52,249
Sam the Slayer.

282
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:53,917
You gonna slay me
with that sword?

283
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:55,419
Brant:
<i>Look at his hand shake.</i>

284
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:57,587
Gilly, go on.

285
00:21:57,622 --> 00:21:59,856
Get back to your room,
lock the door.

286
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,895
- I'm warning you.
- Come on.

287
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,797
Come on.

288
00:22:07,732 --> 00:22:10,167
( grunts )

289
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:11,835
Sam!

290
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:14,371
You lying
sack of shit.

291
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:16,206
Derek:
<i>Killed a white walker, eh?</i>

292
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,708
- You fat-ass fuck.
- ( groans )

293
00:22:18,743 --> 00:22:20,143
Come on, get up.

294
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:23,246
- Gilly: <i>No!</i>
- This your hero? This hog?

295
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:26,116
Leave him alone!

296
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,852
Stubborn little wildling bitch,
aren't you?

297
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:30,654
- ( Gilly screams )
- ( grunts )

298
00:22:30,688 --> 00:22:32,956
- Come on!
- No!

299
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,159
- Sam! Sam! Sam!
- Come on!

300
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,964
( whimpering )

301
00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:43,834
( grunting )

302
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:47,204
- Gilly: Sam! Sam!
- Derek: Come on.

303
00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:49,005
- Brant: <i>Right.</i>
- ( Gilly crying )

304
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,942
- Derek: <i>I'll deal with this.</i>
- <i>( fabric ripping )</i>

305
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:55,612
- Derek: <i>Turn her over.</i>
- Brant: All right.

306
00:22:57,582 --> 00:23:00,817
I said get your hands
off her.

307
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:02,486
Brant: You're gonna get
yourself killed.

308
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,021
Your lover Jon Snow's
not here to save you.

309
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:07,724
I killed a white walker,
I killed a Thenn.

310
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:10,560
I'll take
my chances with you.

311
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:15,265
<i>( snarling, growling )</i>

312
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:24,141
<i>( barks )</i>

313
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:28,945
- <i>( door slams )</i>
- Sam!

314
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:32,682
- I'm all right.
- You're not.

315
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:35,318
Just a bit woozy.

316
00:23:52,136 --> 00:23:55,272
( wincing )

317
00:23:59,577 --> 00:24:02,579
The next time you see
something like that, you leave it alone.

318
00:24:02,647 --> 00:24:05,615
<i>I will not.</i>
<i>They would have--</i>

319
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:10,654
I don't know what
they would have done.

320
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:13,190
I know they would have killed you
if Ghost hadn't come.

321
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:16,526
No. No, no.
They were tiring out.

322
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:19,329
I had them
in the palm of my hand.

323
00:24:20,231 --> 00:24:22,566
Don't be stupid, Sam.

324
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,335
You're not a fighter.

325
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:26,937
What kind of man
would I be

326
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:29,639
if I ran away when I saw
someone hurting you?

327
00:24:29,674 --> 00:24:32,342
Just promise me

328
00:24:32,376 --> 00:24:34,978
whatever happens,
you'll take care of Little Sam.

329
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:36,913
But of course I will.

330
00:24:36,948 --> 00:24:39,449
And...

331
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:42,018
I'll take care
of you, too.

332
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:50,160
I need more water.

333
00:24:53,731 --> 00:24:55,932
Stay.

334
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:58,101
<i>Please?</i>

335
00:25:46,284 --> 00:25:47,284
( breathing quickens )

336
00:25:56,427 --> 00:25:58,061
( winces )

337
00:25:58,095 --> 00:25:59,729
Am I hurting you?

338
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:05,201
Are you sure?

339
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:34,397
( moans )

340
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,900
Oh, my!

341
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,505
<i>( chains rattling )</i>

342
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,963
- ( whip cracks )
- ( grunts )

343
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:56,399
Malko: <i>A rare find</i>
<i>for the fighting pits, my friends.</i>

344
00:26:56,433 --> 00:27:00,603
Not your usual street tough
or drunken pirate.

345
00:27:00,637 --> 00:27:03,940
This one's
a Westerosi knight

346
00:27:03,974 --> 00:27:08,277
from an ancient house
trained in sword and lance.

347
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:10,780
He fought beside
the stag king Robert

348
00:27:10,814 --> 00:27:12,582
on the far side
of the Narrow Sea.

349
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:15,952
<i>He was first through the breach</i>
<i>during the Siege of Spike,</i>

350
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:19,322
slaughtering 50 men
with his flaming sword.

351
00:27:19,356 --> 00:27:23,526
He killed the great Khal Drogo
in single combat.

352
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,862
Betrayed by his woman,

353
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:29,265
he sold himself into slavery
to repay his debts.

354
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:33,402
- <i>Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.</i>
- ( crowd murmurs )

355
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:36,772
13.
Do I have 14?

356
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:41,802
15?
15 gold honors.

357
00:27:41,902 --> 00:27:45,138
Do I hear 16?
16?

358
00:27:45,172 --> 00:27:47,106
20.

359
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:48,641
Sold.

360
00:27:57,952 --> 00:28:00,887
Wait! You have
to buy me as well.

361
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:02,388
Why?

362
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,091
We're a team.

363
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,593
I'm a great fighter, too.

364
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,762
( laughing )

365
00:28:09,797 --> 00:28:12,632
He's funny.
You have to give him that.

366
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,735
( laughing )

367
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:17,270
( grunts )

368
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:20,940
- ( grunting )
- ( laughing continues )

369
00:28:22,376 --> 00:28:26,479
( grunting, shouting )

370
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,662
You're right,
he's funny.

371
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,304
Thank you, my lord.
Thank you.

372
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:52,872
Yes.

373
00:28:52,907 --> 00:28:54,874
My lord, if I may.

374
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:57,343
I've heard Meereen
has become a free city.

375
00:28:57,378 --> 00:29:00,246
You might run into trouble if you try
to fight slaves in the fighting pits.

376
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:02,916
Now, if you were to fight freed men
who'd be paid a wage--

377
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,787
There's your wages,
funny man.

378
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:10,490
Should last the rest
of your life.

379
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:15,061
Malko: These are warrior hands,
not a serving girl's.

380
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:16,896
5, going once...

381
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:19,065
( giggles )

382
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:24,337
How long before the King of Meereen
comes to claim my pillow?

383
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,306
Don't be ridiculous.

384
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,076
My marriage to Hizdahr
is political.

385
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,679
I think he's smart enough
to understand that.

386
00:29:34,114 --> 00:29:36,282
I think the Sons of the Harpy
have stopped killing

387
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,685
because their leader
was made king.

388
00:29:41,422 --> 00:29:43,790
Are you jealous?

389
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,059
You think I'm petty enough
to speak ill of a man

390
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:47,963
just because he represents
competition?

391
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,987
I do.

392
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:52,609
( laughs )

393
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:53,991
You're right.

394
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,827
My motivations
are entirely impure.

395
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,437
Doesn't make me wrong.

396
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:15,979
You told me yourself
I can't fight enemies within and without.

397
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,448
So when enemies without
come knocking,

398
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,617
I need the city
of Meereen behind me.

399
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,153
I have no choice.

400
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,855
Everyone has a choice.

401
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,590
Even slaves
have a choice--

402
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,191
death or slavery.

403
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,295
So what else
can I do, hmm?

404
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,098
Marry me instead.

405
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:41,038
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

406
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,639
I couldn't.

407
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,441
Why not?

408
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,510
You are queen.
You can do what you like.

409
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:52,082
No, I can't.

410
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,252
Then you are the only person
in Meereen who's not free.

411
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:10,701
And I know I'm here
to serve my queen and not give advice,

412
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,236
but can I make
one more suggestion?

413
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,109
Of course.

414
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:24,214
On the day
of the great games,

415
00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:27,084
gather all the Great Masters
and Wise Masters

416
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:30,253
and Worthy Masters
you can find

417
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,255
and slaughter
them all.

418
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:39,329
I am a queen,
not a butcher.

419
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:47,270
All rulers are either
butchers or meat.

420
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:59,282
You there.
Where would I find the High Septon

421
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,719
or High Sparrow or whatever bloody
fool name he's got?

422
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,656
It's not as good a name
as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.

423
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,860
You should have
the decency

424
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,429
to stand when
you speak to a lady.

425
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,198
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.

426
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,767
Don't spar with me,
little fellow.

427
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,669
( groans )

428
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,839
For me,
it's the knees.

429
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,775
- You?
- Hips.

430
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,044
Ah.

431
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,814
A man of the people.
Is that your game?

432
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:34,618
It's an old game.
Dull and unconvincing.

433
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:36,787
A man of the people

434
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,589
who does Cersei's
dirty work for her.

435
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,526
The people always
do the dirty work.

436
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,695
Spare me the homilies.
I can smell a fraud from a mile away.

437
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,130
Useful talent.

438
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm here for my grandson
and granddaughter.

439
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,436
Your grandson
and granddaughter

440
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,739
swore sacred vows
and lied.

441
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,241
The Father judges us all.

442
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,710
Sons of high lords,

443
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,746
sons of fishermen.

444
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,249
If you break his laws,
you will be punished.

445
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,685
Don't you
walk away from me.

446
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,921
You don't give commands
here, Lady Olenna.

447
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,389
What is it you want?

448
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,458
Gold?

449
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,461
I'll make you the richest septon
who ever lived.

450
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,962
( chuckles )

451
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:21,431
What, then?

452
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,401
I imagine this
is strange for you.

453
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,903
Everyone you meet
has a hidden motive

454
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:30,240
and you pride yourself
on sniffing it out.

455
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,709
<i>But I'm telling you</i>
<i>a simple truth.</i>

456
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:35,112
I serve the gods.

457
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,114
The gods demand justice.

458
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,449
How do they communicate
their demands?

459
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,351
By raven or horse?

460
00:33:41,385 --> 00:33:44,254
By the holy text,
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

461
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,790
If you don't have one
in your library,

462
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,091
<i>I'll give you my own.</i>

463
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,627
I've read
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

464
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:54,998
<i>Then you'll remember the</i>
<i>passages concerning buggery and perjury.</i>

465
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:57,134
Your grandchildren
will be punished

466
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:02,072
in the same manner as anyone
who breaks the sacred laws.

467
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,540
Half the men,
women, and children

468
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:07,210
in this foul city
break the sacred laws.

469
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,347
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,

470
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,415
and yet you
punish Loras

471
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,952
for shagging
some perfumed ponce

472
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,988
and Margaery for defending
her brother?

473
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:22,592
Yes. The gods' laws
must be applied to all equally.

474
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,362
If it's equality
you want, so be it.

475
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:29,399
When House Tyrell stops sending
our crops to the capital,

476
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,501
everyone here will starve.

477
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,738
And I'll make sure
the hungry know who's to blame.

478
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,541
( chuckles )

479
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,744
Have you ever sowed the field,
Lady Olenna?

480
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:45,849
Have you ever
reaped the grain?

481
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,817
Has anyone
in House Tyrell?

482
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,754
A lifetime of wealth
and power

483
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,822
has left you
blind in one eye.

484
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,828
You are the few,
we are the many.

485
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:04,067
And when the many
stop fearing the few...

486
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,148
<i>( dog barking )</i>

487
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,951
Lady Olenna.

488
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,663
Cersei: <i>Starving yourself</i>
<i>won't make things</i>

489
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,132
<i>any better for her,</i>
<i>my love.</i>

490
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,570
She's in a prison cell

491
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,740
and there is nothing
I can do.

492
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,745
I am the king!

493
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,015
The queen is in prison
and there is nothing I can do!

494
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,799
No matter who you are,

495
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,868
no matter how strong
you are, sooner or later,

496
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:14,504
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

497
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:17,540
Events you couldn't
possibly have anticipated

498
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,242
or prevented
even if you had.

499
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,279
You cannot blame
yourself for fate.

500
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,015
Your father,

501
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,716
your brother,
your grandfather--

502
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,886
I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms
and what could I do?

503
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,656
Hold them as they
left this world.

504
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,557
Kissed their heads
after they'd gone.

505
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,693
I'll call in the army.

506
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,095
I'll take back
the Sept

507
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,632
and kill every
last one of them.

508
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,003
I'll start a war
if I have to.

509
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,607
You know as well as I do who the
first casualty of that war would be.

510
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,347
I love her.

511
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,652
I love her...

512
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,589
and I can't help her.

513
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,007
We must be strong
for those we love.

514
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,376
We cannot give in
to despair.

515
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,346
I will speak
with the High Sparrow.

516
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,880
There must be
something he--

517
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,183
Let me talk to him
on your behalf.

518
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:37,153
The king cannot sully himself
negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.

519
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,490
You will try
to help her?

520
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,960
I'll do everything I can to win
her freedom and her brother's.

521
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:47,063
Your happiness is all
I want in this world.

522
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:51,101
- I know.
- No, you don't.

523
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,473
You can't possibly.

524
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,177
Not until you have
children of your own.

525
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,913
I would do anything
for you.

526
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,784
Anything to keep
you from harm.

527
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,322
I would burn cities
to the ground.

528
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:17,394
You are all that matters.

529
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:21,498
You and your sister.

530
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,401
From the moment you came
into this world.

531
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,970
My boy.

532
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,374
My only boy.

533
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,486
<i>( door opens )</i>

534
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:47,924
Prince Doran hopes
this satisfies

535
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,827
your concerns
about the princess's well-being.

536
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:59,903
You looked different
when I left.

537
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,071
You had more hair.

538
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:05,108
And more hands.

539
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,744
- How's Trystane?
- He'll be all right.

540
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:08,945
I'm sorry for that.

541
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,580
It wasn't supposed
to happen that way.

542
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,549
Why is it
happening at all?

543
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,419
Your mother's
worried about you.

544
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,721
Threats have been made.

545
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,190
Dorne's too dangerous
for you.

546
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,725
- I've come to take you home.
- This is my home.

547
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,260
This has been
my home for years.

548
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,663
I didn't want to come here,
but she told me to.

549
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,931
I did what she said.

550
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,700
I did my duty and now
she's forcing me to go back?

551
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:33,536
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.

552
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,039
<i>No, it's not complicated at all.</i>
<i>It's simple.</i>

553
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,575
I love Trystane,
I'm going to marry him,

554
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,076
and we're staying
right here.

555
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,945
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

556
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,080
You don't know me.

557
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:56,192
Bronn: <i>♪ Brothers, O brothers,</i>

563

( clapping )

564
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,984
He's got a good voice.

565
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:22,819
We're lucky
he's a singer.

566
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,321
If he were a fighter,
we might have been in trouble.

567
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,424
It's against my code
to hurt a woman.

568
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,594
It's amazing how many men we beat
seem to have this code.

569
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,329
I wouldn't say
you beat me.

570
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,098
How's your arm?

571
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:36,933
Wonderful.

572
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:40,036
Wouldn't feel right
to leave Dorne without a new scar.

573
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,238
( scoffs ) You think you're
leaving Dorne?

574
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,307
No great hurry.

575
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:47,176
Dornish women are the most beautiful
women in the world.

576
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,444
Thank you.

577
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,781
I said Dornish women.
I didn't say you.

578
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,986
I'm not the most beautiful woman
you've ever seen?

579
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,789
Bronn: <i>I've seen</i>
<i>quite a few women</i>

580
00:40:59,823 --> 00:41:01,357
<i>in all</i>
<i>the Seven Kingdoms.</i>

581
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,928
Name one more beautiful
than I am.

582
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,866
Well, now,
in King's Landing,

583
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,536
<i>there was an absolutely</i>
<i>gorgeous...</i>

584
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,275
There was a what?

585
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,614
<i>In King's Landing,</i>
<i>you were saying?</i>

586
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,683
Was I?

587
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,752
There was a woman
more beautiful than I am.

588
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,688
Was there?

589
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,923
My memory's not
what it was earlier.

590
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,795
How's your arm now?

591
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,597
You seem
concerned with it.

592
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,632
<i>You must really like me.</i>

593
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,201
( laughs )

594
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:54,310
And how about
your head?

595
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,984
<i>My head?</i>

596
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,219
My head?

597
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:06,122
You don't even want
to know what's going on in--

598
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:11,260
( breathing heavily )

599
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,434
Your nose is bleeding.

600
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,107
It's nothing.
It's the dry air.

601
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:31,648
My dagger was coated
with a special ointment from Asshai.

602
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:34,384
<i>They call it</i>
<i>the Long Farewell.</i>

603
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,452
It takes time to work,

604
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,590
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,

605
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,858
death.

606
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,402
The only antidote.

607
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,676
Who's the most
beautiful woman in the world?

608
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:02,412
( quietly )
You.

609
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,215
Sorry? Who?

610
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,687
You.

611
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,622
Don't drop it.

612
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,536
( gasping )

613
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,338
I think you're
very handsome as well.

614
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,886
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

615
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,257
It felt like
the safest place.

616
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,559
Not for your
clientele, clearly.

617
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,963
It was an establishment
like no other.

618
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,166
The sheer range
of appetites catered to.

619
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,968
Desires that
didn't even exist

620
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,871
until we invented them.

621
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:38,241
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

622
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:42,211
The past is the past.

623
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:45,748
The future is all
that's worth discussing.

624
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:48,918
The future
of House Tyrell.

625
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,754
Don't pretend to have
any concern for my house,

626
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,389
my grandchildren or me.

627
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:56,159
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

628
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,327
as soon as things
started to go wrong.

629
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,797
- I promise you--
- I promise you, Lord Baelish,

630
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,965
that our fates
are joined.

631
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,967
Together we murdered a king.

632
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:08,471
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

633
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,975
And if I should meet
with some accident

634
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,179
here at your broken
little flesh market,

635
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,549
they'll never even find
what's left of you.

636
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,118
So...

637
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:24,187
do you deny a part
in all this?

638
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,557
Cersei summoned me
to King's Landing.

639
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:29,025
I dared not refuse her.

640
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,827
And what did she want?

641
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:34,096
<i>A piece of information</i>
<i>she knew that I had.</i>

642
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:37,633
Neither silence
nor lies were an option.

643
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:40,169
But I have
other information

644
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,038
of which she is unaware.

645
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:46,342
And as you say,
our interests are aligned.

646
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,079
I have a gift for you.

647
00:45:50,113 --> 00:45:51,814
What kind of gift?

648
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:55,051
The same kind
I gave Cersei.

649
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,153
A handsome young man.

650
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,469
Yezzan: <i>Many worthy fighters</i>
<i>have died</i>

651
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,072
<i>trying to make it</i>
<i>to the great games.</i>

652
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,208
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

653
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:22,378
it will represent
a significant rise in your station.

654
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:25,248
But if you do happen
to triumph here,

655
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,184
<i>you will fight at the Great Pit</i>
<i>of Daznak itself</i>

656
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:29,886
<i>in front of the queen.</i>

657
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,323
So whatever happens,
the gods have smiled upon you today.

658
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:38,594
This is the day your lives actually start
to mean something.

659
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,399
You and you.
You.

660
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,636
You two.

661
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,406
<i>You, you, and you.</i>

662
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,175
Up.

663
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,178
- <i>Valar morghulis.</i>
- Men: <i>Valar dohaeris.</i>

664
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,381
Prepare yourselves.

665
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,029
Sitting through the great games
will be bad enough.

666
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:16,198
For generations in the days leading up
to the great games,

667
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,733
it has been customary
for our ruler

668
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,568
to make the rounds
of the lower pits

669
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,204
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.

670
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:29,211
- <i>( applause, cheering )</i>
- Move yourselves.

671
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,752
Your Grace.

672
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,354
Your future Grace.

673
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,623
You honor us all.

674
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,194
Stand there.

675
00:47:45,228 --> 00:47:48,064
Stand straight.
That's the fucking queen.

676
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,534
( softly )
We fight and die for your glory,

677
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,536
O glorious queen.

678
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,240
All: We fight and die
for your glory,

679
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,176
<i>O glorious queen.</i>

680
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,610
<i>( crowd shouting )</i>

681
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,347
- Man: <i>Fight!</i>
- <i>( metal clanging )</i>

682
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,819
<i>( men shouting,</i>
<i>grunting )</i>

683
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,955
<i>( applause, cheering )</i>

684
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,639
( screams )

685
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,691
( shouting )

686
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,773
I think I've seen enough.

687
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,776
Your Grace,
it is a tradition

688
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,012
for the queen to stay
until the victor has emerged.

689
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:12,127
I've sacrificed more than enough
for your traditions.

690
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,754
What are you doing?

691
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,131
Wait your turn,
you piece of fucking filth.

692
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,033
- ( grunts )
- <i>( crowd cheering )</i>

693
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,980
<i>( crowd cheering )</i>

694
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,656
( screams )

695
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:01,263
( grunting )

696
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,980
<i>( applause )</i>

697
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,303
<i>( applause, cheering )</i>

698
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,956
Get him out
of my sight.

699
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,225
Khaleesi, please.

700
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,694
I just need
a moment of your time.

701
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,530
I brought you a gift.

702
00:51:08,431 --> 00:51:10,332
Tyrion:
<i>It's true.</i>

703
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,036
He has.

704
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,905
Who are you?

705
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,308
I am the gift.

706
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,946
<i>It's a pleasure</i>
<i>to meet you, Your Grace.</i>

707
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:27,082
My name
is Tyrion Lannister.

708
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,934
( coughs )

709
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:00,115
<i>( door closes, locks )</i>

710
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,017
Cersei:
<i>This is horrible.</i>

711
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,119
Unacceptable.

712
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:08,123
Are they feeding you
enough at least?

713
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:12,394
I brought you this.
Venison.

714
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,730
It's quite good.

715
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:20,669
I had it myself for supper
only last night.

716
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:27,543
We did everything we could
from the moment they took your brother.

717
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,812
<i>Tommen even went</i>
<i>to the Sept himself</i>

718
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,348
<i>to confront</i>
<i>the High Sparrow.</i>

719
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:35,251
But I fear the Faith
has left reason behind.

720
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:38,354
I know you did this.

721
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:42,191
We are making every effort
on your behalf.

722
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,827
I swear to you
by all the seven gods.

723
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:46,895
Lies come
easily to you.

724
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,397
Everyone knows that.

725
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,333
<i>But innocence,</i>

726
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,936
<i>decency, concern,</i>

727
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,905
you're not very good
at those, I'm afraid.

728
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,509
Perhaps that's why
your son was so eager

729
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,611
to cast you aside
for me.

730
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,782
You're upset.

731
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:08,984
You're not
thinking clearly.

732
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,353
I'll visit again when you've
had a chance to calm down.

733
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,422
I don't want
to see you again.

734
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,891
<i>I do hope you change</i>
<i>your mind about that.</i>

735
00:53:15,925 --> 00:53:18,460
I've been told
men often go mad

736
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,963
in the Black Cells
beneath the Red Keep.

737
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,798
<i>Though I suppose</i>
<i>your isolation will end</i>

738
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,000
when your trial begins.

739
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,203
Leave.

740
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,172
Yes.

741
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,707
I'm afraid I must.

742
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,709
<i>My son needs me now</i>
<i>more than ever.</i>

743
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:36,612
Get out,
you hateful bitch!

744
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,656
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

745
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,124
<i>( door opens )</i>

746
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,628
Sleep well, sister.

747
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,101
- ( sighs )
- <i>( lock clicks )</i>

748
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,757
Thank you, Boake.

749
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,399
- You saw her?
- Yes.

750
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,268
- And?
- Her accommodations seem sufficient.

751
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:35,604
What happens
to her now?

752
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:38,073
Well, she and her brother
are both being held

753
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,842
under fair suspicion.

754
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:42,511
A trial will be held
for each of them

755
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:45,381
to determine if they're
guilty of any acts

756
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:49,184
that might constitute
a violation of the tenets of the faith.

757
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,086
Who will stand judge?

758
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:55,357
Seven septons as it was in all trials
before the Targaryens.

759
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:57,793
Will you be
one of them?

760
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,294
I will.

761
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,632
If one
or both of them

762
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:06,402
were to confess
before the trial...

763
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,337
Then they will be shown
the Mother's mercy.

764
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,074
And what does
the Mother's mercy entail?

765
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,343
It depends upon
the situation.

766
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:17,346
The acts themselves,
the degree of contrition.

767
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,115
Thank you,
High Septon,

768
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,118
for bringing them
whatever justice they deserve

769
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,988
<i>in the eyes</i>
<i>of the Seven.</i>

770
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,493
<i>Did you know</i>
<i>this chapel</i>

771
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:34,463
is one of the oldest structures
in King's Landing?

772
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:38,300
I think I may have
heard at one point.

773
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:41,136
Baelor built his Sept
around it.

774
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,674
But men worshipped here
long before him.

775
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:48,477
Who carved this altar?

776
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,980
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.

777
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:54,383
No one does.

778
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:58,020
There's no name on it
or anywhere else in the chapel.

779
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,524
No, the people
who built this place

780
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,562
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them

781
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:10,332
the way Baelor did with that
great gilded monstrosity up there.

782
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,167
Hmm.

783
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,336
Their faith was clean.

784
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:18,340
Strip away the gold
and the ornaments,

785
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:22,144
knock down the statues
and the pillars,

786
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,279
and this is what remains.

787
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,885
Something simple...

788
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:36,558
and solid and true.

789
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:44,132
The Tyrells' finery
will be stripped away.

790
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:47,069
<i>Their lies knocked down.</i>

791
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,239
<i>Their true hearts</i>
<i>laid bare for all to see.</i>

792
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,376
And so it will be
for all of us.

793
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,012
High and low alike.

794
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,218
What will we find

795
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,255
when we strip away
your finery?

796
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:13,028
<i>A young man came to us</i>
<i>not long ago.</i>

797
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,964
Broken in body
and spirit.

798
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:20,502
He had so much
to strip away.

799
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:25,908
<i>So much</i>
<i>weighing him down.</i>

800
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,177
<i>But piece by piece,</i>
<i>he unburdened himself.</i>

801
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,614
<i>Let go of vanity,</i>

802
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:35,217
pride, sin.

803
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,188
Now his soul is so light,

804
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:43,492
he will float through
the Seven Heavens like a bird.

805
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,227
Hmm.

806
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,801
And he has much
to say about you.

807
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:54,937
<i>( door opens )</i>

808
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:58,140
<i>( door closes )</i>

809
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:18,827
Move.

810
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,365
Let me go
immediately.

811
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:26,435
You will order her
to let me go.

812
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:29,137
I am the queen!
I am the queen!

813
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,872
Have you lost your mind?

814
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:32,441
Let me go!

815
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,078
<i>Get your filthy hands</i>
<i>off me!</i>

816
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:38,447
<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

817
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:41,383
<i>I am the queen!</i>
<i>Let me go!</i>

818
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:49,558
Look at me.

819
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,562
Look at my face.

820
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:59,534
It's the last thing
you'll see before you die.
