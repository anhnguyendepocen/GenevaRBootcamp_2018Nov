You won't like the answers.

34

When will we marry?

36

You will never wed the prince.

37

You will wed the king.

38
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:18,970

Oh, yes.

40
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,720
You'll be queen.

47
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:44,699
No. The king will have 20
children and you will have three.

48
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:45,803
That doesn't make sense.

49

I want a moment alone with him.

66
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:55,505

day and night to be here from
all seven kingdoms.

68

00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:28,796
He never wanted you

72
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:32,547
but here you are,
protecting his dead body.

What he built, it's ours.

74
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:42,422
He built it for us.
He meant it for us.

75
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,171
They're going to try

- They?

All of them out there,
our enemies.

78
00:07:49,256 --> 00:07:52,046
They're waiting in line to make sure
he's really dead.

79
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,838
And as soon as they see
the stones on his eyes,

80
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,671
they'll set to work
on tearing us apart.

81
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:59,421
They have nothing to do with it.

82

The man who murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

83
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,046
He's the enemy.
I've been telling you for years.

84
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:05,088
You've been defending
him for years.

85
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,255
This is exactly what they want.

86
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:08,880
And now our father is dead

87
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:12,339

is out there somewhere drawing breath.

88

Tyrion may be a monster,

90
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:24,963
but at least he killed
our father on purpose.

91
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:27,088
You killed him by mistake.

92

for the disaster he was.

128
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,880

by supporting
a Targaryen restoration.

130
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:31,046
And thus began
the chain of mistakes

131
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:33,671
that has led us both here.

132

Things have gotten worse,

133

166
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:49,380
It was only a matter
of time, Your Grace.

167
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,880
Conquerors always meet
with resistance.

168
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:53,963
I didn't conquer them.
Their own people did.

169
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:57,968
_

170
00:15:58,088 --> 00:16:01,848
_

171
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:05,046
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

172
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,046
so cowards in masks
could take it away.

173
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:08,546
And I did not take up
residence in this pyramid

174
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:12,005
so I could watch the city below
decline into chaos.

175
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:14,546
What was the name
of the man you lost?

176
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:18,005
White Rat, Your Grace.

177
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:22,171
I want him buried
with honor, publically

178
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:24,588
in the Temple of the Graces.

179
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:26,630
The Sons of the Harpy
will hear that message.

180
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,338
Make them very angry.

181
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:30,296
Angry snakes lash out.

182
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:33,005
Makes chopping off their heads
that much easier.

183
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:36,422
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

184
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:41,467
Your Grace.

185
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:57,296
Torgo Nudho.

186
00:16:57,297 --> 00:16:59,172
Missandei hin Naath.

187
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:02,756
I wanted to speak with you.

188
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,921
Why do you come?

189
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:16,881
White Rat, the Unsullied who...

190
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,381
I have heard they found
his body in a brothel.

191
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,546
I have heard that
more than one Unsullied

192
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,214
has been known to visit
Meereen's brothels.

193
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:33,714
May I ask you why?

194
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:37,797
Why would an Unsullied
go to a brothel?

195
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:44,297
I do not know.

196
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:47,839
<i>I must go.</i>

197
00:17:57,506 --> 00:17:59,131
(shouts, grunting)

198
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:05,046
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

199
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:07,338
If it wasn't heavy,
it wouldn't stop a sword.

200
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:08,881
Now get it up.

201
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:24,046
Come.
Try it again.

202
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:27,171
Drive at me.
Keep your shield up.

203
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,630
Or I'll ring
your head like a bell.

204
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:32,421
Shouldn't you be training, too?

205
00:18:32,422 --> 00:18:34,922
Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

206
00:18:38,214 --> 00:18:40,755
How many brothers can say that they've
killed a white walker and a Thenn?

207
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:43,880
I might be the first in history.

208
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:45,796
- Man:<i> Shield up.</i>
- Alliser:<i> These men need a firm hand.</i>

209
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:47,546
Always have.

210
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:49,714
They're poachers and thieves.

211
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,297
Not soldiers.

212
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:01,881
That one hates me.

213
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:06,213
Sam: If Ser Alliser
is chosen as the new Lord Commander...

214
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:09,880
- He hates the wildlings.
- <i> (baby fussing)</i>

215
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,671
All the wildlings.

216
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:14,255
- Don't let them send us away.
- <i> It's not a sure thing.</i>

217
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:16,796
Ser Denys Mallister has
commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years

218
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:18,630
and people say he's a good man.

219
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:19,755
He's running against
Ser Alliser--

220
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:22,380
Sam, don't let them
send us away.

221
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:23,630
I told you.

222
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:26,755
Wherever you go, I go, too.

223
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:29,047
You can't leave.
They'll execute you.

224
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:39,007
- Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.
- Yah!

225
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:41,756
Shield up.

226
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:46,214
The king wants a word.

227
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,214
(chains rattling)

228
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:02,922
(wind howling)

229
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,838
You're not cold, my lady?

230
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,005
Never.

231
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:22,006
The Lord's fire lives
within me, Jon Snow.

232
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,547
Feel.

233
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:35,631
Are you a virgin?

234
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,172
No.

235
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:44,631
Good.

236
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:53,796
Your Grace.

237
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:56,006
The bastard of Winterfell.

238
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:06,839
You know who rules
at Winterfell now?

239
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:09,796
Roose Bolton.

240
00:21:09,797 --> 00:21:13,089
Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

241
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,631
Don't you want to avenge him?

242
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:20,963
I want a great
many things, Your Grace.

243
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:23,463
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

244
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:26,796
I've been talking
to your sworn brothers.

245
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:28,505
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

246
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:30,213
<i>Many don't.</i>

247
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:34,213
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

248
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:35,880
<i>Why?</i>

249
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:37,088
It's where she belonged.

250
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,505
Some of the Night's
Watch feel you have

251
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,463
too much affection
for the wildlings.

252
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:43,880
They were born on the
wrong side of the Wall.

253
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:45,921
That doesn't make them monsters.

254
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,213
No matter.

255
00:21:47,214 --> 00:21:48,213
I shall take back the North

256
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:50,130
from the thieves who stole it.

257
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:52,713
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

258
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:56,296
I shall mount Roose Bolton's
head on a spike.

259
00:21:56,297 --> 00:21:59,005
But if I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

260
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,005
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part--

261
00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:04,005
I'm not talking about
the damn Night's Watch.

262
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,756
I'm talking about the wildlings.

263
00:22:13,756 --> 00:22:17,880
Your Grace,
you want the wildlings

264
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:19,880
to march in your army?

265
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,171
If they swear to follow me,
I'll pardon them.

266
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:23,755
We'll take Winterfell.
Once the North is won,

267
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:24,671
I'll declare them
citizens of the realm.

268
00:22:24,672 --> 00:22:26,880
I'll give them land to live on.

269
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:31,046
It's a fair offer.
More than fair.

270
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:33,005
I'll offer them their lives
and their freedom

271
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:36,046
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

272
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:37,168
I don't think that's likely.

273
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:41,421
You admire him, don't you?

274
00:22:41,422 --> 00:22:44,171
- I respect him.
- He likes you.

275
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:46,088
- Convince him to bend the knee...
- Your Grace.

276
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:47,422
...or he burns.

277
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:52,796
How much time do I have?

278
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:54,463
Nightfall.

279
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,755
The sun drops fast
this time of year.

280
00:22:56,756 --> 00:22:58,421
<i>Hurry, Jon Snow.</i>

281
00:22:58,422 --> 00:23:02,046
(boys grunting)

282
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,630
Master-of-arms:
<i>Shield up.</i>

283
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:06,463
- (Robin whimpers)
- Master-of-arms:<i> Attack, my lord!</i>

284
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:07,838
Attack!

285
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,463
- Don't cross your feet.
- (grunts)

286
00:23:11,464 --> 00:23:13,213
My sons had swords
in their hands

287
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:14,838
from the time they could walk.
This one...

288
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,005
Littlefinger: <i>Lord Arryn will never</i>
<i>be a great warrior.</i>

289
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:19,005
Royce:
<i>Great warrior?</i>

290
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:21,630
He swings a sword
like a girl with palsy.

291
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:24,546
My lord.

292
00:23:24,547 --> 00:23:26,421
Master-of-arms:
<i>Sword up, my lord!</i>

293
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:29,381
<i>(Robin whimpering, gasping)</i>

294
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:35,796
Some boys develop more slowly.

295
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:38,088
He's still young.

296
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:41,213
He's 13.
Boys go to war at 13.

297
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:43,255
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

298
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:46,046
The gift of a great name.

299
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:49,796
Sometimes that's all one needs.

300
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:52,464
(Robin whimpering)

301
00:23:54,756 --> 00:23:57,505
Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you
for all you've done for me.

302
00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:59,921
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

303
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:01,255
I have no doubt
that on my return,

304
00:24:01,256 --> 00:24:04,213
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

305
00:24:04,214 --> 00:24:05,380
He'll be safe here.

306
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:09,338
<i>As for his skills,</i>

307
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:11,547
I make no promises.

308
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:14,922
<i>(birds screeching)</i>

309
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,713
Will we head north
at some point?

310
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:31,005
He said Sansa had a brother
at Castle Black.

311
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:32,630
We're a few days' ride
from the Kingsroad.

312
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:35,714
- But that will take us--
- Us?

313
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:40,255
The only reason you're here
is because Jaime Lannister

314
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:41,922
told me you weren't
safe in the capital.

315
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:47,005
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

316
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:49,005
No one knows what you look like.

317
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:51,421
No one cares.
You're safe.

318
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:54,922
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know what a squire is?

319
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:57,505
An attendant to a knight.

320
00:24:57,506 --> 00:25:00,130
I'm not a knight.

321
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,380
That means you're not a squire.

322
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:03,463
Well, where would I go?

323
00:25:03,464 --> 00:25:06,339
I don't care.
I'm not your mother.

324
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:17,130
You swore to find
the Stark girls.

325
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:19,921
I found Arya. She didn't want
my protection.

326
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:22,131
- <i> Sansa still might.</i>
- Will you shut your mouth?

327
00:25:23,297 --> 00:25:25,131
I didn't ask for your advice.

328
00:25:26,964 --> 00:25:29,796
I don't want anyone
following me.

329
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:31,713
I'm not a leader.

330
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:34,713
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord I believed in.

331
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:37,631
The good lords are dead
and the rest are monsters.

332
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:43,171
- <i> (horse whinnies)</i>
- <i> (hoofbeats approaching)</i>

333
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:46,964
(horses neighing)

334
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,880
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

335
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:53,088
I did.

336
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:56,213
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

337
00:25:56,214 --> 00:25:58,172
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

338
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:03,463
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

339
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:05,838
but he's not alone
in that castle.

340
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,921
Do you trust all those
knights and ladies,

341
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:10,130
<i>stable boys and serving girls?</i>

342
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:13,088
No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

343
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:14,546
No.
(chuckles)

344
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:17,171
But I pay them well

345
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:19,463
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

346
00:26:19,464 --> 00:26:21,838
So where are we going?

347
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,255
To a land where
you trust everyone?

348
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:27,005
To a land so far from here,

349
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:28,926
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

350
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:40,881
It was such a deep,
deep shock to us all.

351
00:26:44,422 --> 00:26:45,588
Your father was a--

352
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:48,546
a force to be reckoned with.

353
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:49,755
He truly was.

354
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:52,921
I wouldn't presume to claim

355
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:55,255
to have known him
as such, but--

356
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:58,796
<i>but just being in his presence was enough</i>
<i>to make it so clear</i>

357
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:00,963
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

358
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:04,338
What a-- what a force
to be reckoned with.

359
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:06,880
(sighs)

360
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:09,256
Thank you so much
for your kind words.

361
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:16,463
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

362
00:27:16,464 --> 00:27:18,505
This tragedy...
I never trusted Varys.

363
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:21,547
I often warned...

364
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:26,381
Your Grace.

365
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:31,630
Cousin Lancel.
I hardly recognized you.

366
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:33,921
My deepest sympathies.

367
00:27:33,922 --> 00:27:37,046
I apologize
for my son's appearance.

368
00:27:37,047 --> 00:27:38,168
Uncle, it's quite all right.

369
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:43,630
They call themselves sparrows.

370
00:27:43,631 --> 00:27:46,338
(chuckles)
Bloody fanatics.

371
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:48,338
Religion has its place,
of course,

372
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:51,171
but at a certain point...

373
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:54,130
They never would have come to the capital
when Tywin was alive.

374
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,796
I'm sure he'll grow out of it,

375
00:27:55,797 --> 00:27:57,796
whatever it is.

376
00:27:57,797 --> 00:28:00,339
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

377
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:21,463
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

378
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:23,839
It wasn't my wounds
that needed healing.

379
00:28:26,547 --> 00:28:29,464
What can I do for you?

380
00:28:30,464 --> 00:28:32,713
You can forgive me.

381
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:35,546
What could you possibly
have done to warrant my forgiveness?

382
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,255
I led you into the darkness.

383
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:39,671
I doubt you've ever
led anyone anywhere.

384
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:42,463
I tempted you into our...

385
00:28:42,464 --> 00:28:45,714
unnatural relations.

386
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:49,714
And, of course,
there was the king...

387
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:54,131
his boar hunt.

388
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:57,214
His wine.

389
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:02,755
I don't know what
you're talking about.

390
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:06,006
I'm a different person now.

391
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:10,546
I've found peace
in the light of the Seven.

392
00:29:10,547 --> 00:29:12,213
<i>You can, too.</i>

393
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:13,838
<i>They watch over all of us,</i>

394
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,380
ready to dole out mercy

395
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,881
or justice.

396
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:23,631
Their world is at hand.

397
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:28,046
I will pray for
your father's soul.

398
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:30,630
(laughs)

399
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:34,214
The day Tywin Lannister's
soul needs your help...

400
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,505
- Olyvar: It looks like Dorne.
- Loras: It doesn't.

401
00:29:45,506 --> 00:29:48,421
(laughs)
It does.

402
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:52,547
That's the--
that's the Sunspear bit right there.

403
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:55,463
And that's where
the mountains are.

404
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:58,796
And over here is--

405
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,588
is Sunsnake?

406
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:02,213
Stonespear?

407
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:04,713
Sandstone.

408
00:30:04,714 --> 00:30:06,296
Yes.

409
00:30:06,297 --> 00:30:08,713
Yes, Sandstone.

410
00:30:08,714 --> 00:30:10,130
(kisses)

411
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:11,463
Just there.

412
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:13,464
Fine.

413
00:30:16,172 --> 00:30:16,839
It's Dorne.

414
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:21,338
We should go there.

415
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:23,713
I think we would
have a lovely time,

416
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:26,088
judging by my experience.

417
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:30,838
That would be wonderful.
Dorne, Highgarden.

418
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,381
Anywhere but here.

419
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,422
We're late for dinner as it is.

420
00:30:44,214 --> 00:30:45,838
You're very respectful.

421
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:46,714
I'm very hungry.

422
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:07,171
What's your name?

423
00:31:07,172 --> 00:31:08,838
Olyvar, my lady.

424
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,671
I'm afraid my brother

425
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:14,131
is keeping the king
waiting, Olyvar.

426
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,839
My lady.

427
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:41,088
Perhaps you might
consider being a bit more discreet?

428
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:42,838
Why?

429
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:45,171
They all know about me anyway.

430
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:48,463
Everybody knows everything
about everyone.

431
00:31:48,464 --> 00:31:51,630
What's the point in trying to
keep a secret in a place like this?

432
00:31:51,631 --> 00:31:54,922
In any event, you shouldn't
keep your intended waiting.

433
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:58,338
My intended?
Please.

434
00:31:58,339 --> 00:31:59,755
<i>Tywin's dead.</i>

435
00:31:59,756 --> 00:32:02,171
<i>That means no one</i>
<i>can force Cersei to marry me.</i>

436
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:04,380
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

437
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,838
You think I want that woman
married to my brother?

438
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,921
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

439
00:32:09,922 --> 00:32:12,630
Which means she stays
in King's Landing.

440
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,213
<i>Which means you're trapped here with
Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.</i>

441
00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:16,797
Perhaps.

442
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,880
Perhaps?

443
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:21,714
Perhaps.

444
00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:25,797
<i>(birds screeching)</i>

445
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:39,296
Eunuch, the Spider, the
Master of Whisperers.

446
00:32:39,297 --> 00:32:42,589
Imp, Half-man.

447
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,255
There are faster ways
to kill yourself.

448
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,005
Not for a coward.

449
00:32:49,006 --> 00:32:51,046
You are many things, my friend,

450
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:52,797
but not a coward.

451
00:32:56,756 --> 00:32:59,130
You never told me
why you set me free.

452
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:02,130
Your brother asked me to.

453
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:03,380
Could have said no.

454
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:06,630
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

455
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:08,880
Not as dangerous
as releasing me.

456
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:11,588
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

457
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,255
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

458
00:33:14,256 --> 00:33:15,838
I didn't do it for you.

459
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,880
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

460
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:22,130
A drunken dwarf will never be the savior
of the Seven Kingdoms.

461
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:24,380
I don't believe in saviors.

462
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:27,756
I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

463
00:33:29,547 --> 00:33:31,171
You're going to have
to find another soldier.

464
00:33:31,172 --> 00:33:35,255
I'm done with Westeros
and Westeros is done with me.

465
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:38,463
You have many
admirable qualities,

466
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:39,838
self-pity is not
one of them.

467
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:42,130
Any fool with a bit of luck

468
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:45,671
can find himself
born into power.

469
00:33:45,672 --> 00:33:49,338
But earning it for yourself,
that takes work.

470
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:51,880
I'm not well-suited
for work.

471
00:33:51,881 --> 00:33:53,505
I think you are.

472
00:33:53,506 --> 00:33:55,588
You have your father's
instincts for politics.

473
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:57,171
And you have compassion.

474
00:33:57,172 --> 00:34:00,380
Compassion? Yes.

475
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:03,005
I killed my lover
with my bare hands.

476
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:06,796
I shot my own father
with a crossbow.

477
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:08,838
I never said you were perfect.

478
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:12,796
What is it you want exactly?

479
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,796
Peace.

480
00:34:14,797 --> 00:34:16,255
Prosperity.

481
00:34:16,256 --> 00:34:20,338
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

482
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,796
Where the castles
are made of gingerbread

483
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:25,296
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

484
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,588
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

485
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:30,005
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

486
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:31,921
Perhaps.

487
00:34:31,922 --> 00:34:35,505
And perhaps we've grown
so used to horror,

488
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,131
we assume there's no other way.

489
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:40,921
<i>If you sat on the Iron Throne,</i>

490
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:43,088
<i>would you spread misery</i>
<i>throughout the land?</i>

491
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:45,505
I will never sit
on the Iron Throne.

492
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:47,921
<i>No, you won't.</i>

493
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:50,296
<i>But you could help another</i>
<i>climb those steps</i>

494
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,796
and take that seat.

495
00:34:52,797 --> 00:34:55,838
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

496
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,130
but gentler than Stannis.

497
00:34:58,131 --> 00:35:01,046
A monarch who can intimidate the
high lords and inspire the people.

498
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:05,130
A ruler loved by millions
with a powerful army

499
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:07,005
and the right family name.

500
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:09,296
Good luck finding him.

501
00:35:09,297 --> 00:35:12,339
Who said anything about "him"?

502
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:18,671
You have a choice, my friend.

503
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:20,671
You can stay here
at Illyrio's palace

504
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:23,255
and drink yourself to death,

505
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:24,588
or you can ride with me
to Meereen,

506
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,046
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

507
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:29,464
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

508
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:35,547
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

509
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:43,964
- <i> (chatter)</i>
- <i> (goat bleating)</i>

510
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:49,088
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

511
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:51,922
Looks like your friends haven't
been behaving themselves.

512
00:35:54,256 --> 00:35:58,088
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

513
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,671
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

514
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:02,546
to a council of elders
made up of both

515
00:36:02,547 --> 00:36:04,963
the freed men and
the former slaveholders.

516
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:07,088
All matters of consequence will be
brought to you for review.

517
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:08,838
Good.

518
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:11,380
They did ask
for some concessions.

519
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:13,130
Concessions?

520
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:16,213
Politics is the art
of compromise, Your Grace.

521
00:36:16,214 --> 00:36:19,130
I'm not a politician.
I'm a queen.

522
00:36:19,131 --> 00:36:22,380
Hizdahr:<i> Forgive me.</i>
<i>You're right, of course.</i>

523
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:26,796
Still, it's easier to rule happy
subjects than angry ones.

524
00:36:26,797 --> 00:36:28,796
I don't expect
the Wise Masters to be happy.

525
00:36:28,797 --> 00:36:31,171
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

526
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:34,255
They do not ask
for the return of slavery.

527
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:36,839
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

528
00:36:38,756 --> 00:36:40,505
The fighting pits?

529
00:36:40,506 --> 00:36:42,005
Where slaves fought
slaves to the death?

530
00:36:42,006 --> 00:36:44,880
In the new world
that you've brought to us,

531
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:47,214
free men would fight free men.

532
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:50,130
<i>The pit fighters you liberated</i>

533
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:52,213
<i>plead for this opportunity.</i>

534
00:36:52,214 --> 00:36:54,546
Bring some here
and ask them yourself.

535
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:55,755
No fighting pits.

536
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,088
Opening them would show
the people of Yunkai

537
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,046
and Meereen that you
respect their traditions.

538
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:02,463
I do not respect the tradition of
human cockfighting.

539
00:37:02,464 --> 00:37:05,714
- If you-- - How many times must I say no
before you understand?

540
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:11,505
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

541
00:37:11,506 --> 00:37:14,046
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

542
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:16,213
You should reopen
the fighting pits.

543
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:19,088
What?

544
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:20,714
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

545
00:37:22,797 --> 00:37:25,463
She liked to drink pear brandy.

546
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:29,546
The older she got, the less
she made selling her body,

547
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,921
the more she wanted to drink.

548
00:37:31,922 --> 00:37:35,130
So one day when I was 12,
she sold me to a slaver

549
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:37,755
she fucked the night before.

550
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,046
I'm sorry.

551
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:42,796
Why?
I was a bad child.

552
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:45,588
I wasn't big, but I was quick.

553
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:47,880
And I loved to fight.

554
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:49,880
So they sold me
to a man in Tolos

555
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:52,046
who trained fighters
for the pits.

556
00:37:52,047 --> 00:37:54,671
I had my first match
when I was 16.

557
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,838
You were sold into slavery,

558
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:59,296
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

559
00:37:59,297 --> 00:38:00,796
and you're defending
the fighting pits?

560
00:38:00,797 --> 00:38:02,505
(laughs)

561
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:05,296
I'm only here
because of those pits.

562
00:38:05,297 --> 00:38:07,921
I learned to fight
like a Dothraki screamer,

563
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:09,338
a Norvoshi priest,
a Westerosi knight.

564
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:11,963
Soon I was famous.

565
00:38:11,964 --> 00:38:14,213
10,000 men and women
screamed my name

566
00:38:14,214 --> 00:38:15,296
when I stepped into the pit.

567
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:16,796
I made so much money
for my master,

568
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:19,588
he set me free when he died.

569
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,380
I joined the Second Sons.

570
00:38:21,381 --> 00:38:24,297
And then I met you.

571
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:31,130
You're the queen.

572
00:38:31,131 --> 00:38:34,671
Everyone's too afraid
of you to speak truth.

573
00:38:34,672 --> 00:38:37,255
Everyone but me.

574
00:38:37,256 --> 00:38:41,463
You've made thousands
of enemies all across the world.

575
00:38:41,464 --> 00:38:44,255
As soon as they see weakness,

576
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:46,505
they'll attack.

577
00:38:46,506 --> 00:38:50,046
Show your strength here, now.

578
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:51,338
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

579
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:54,421
(scoffs)

580
00:38:54,422 --> 00:38:57,963
Anyone with a chest
full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.

581
00:38:57,964 --> 00:39:01,713
You're not
the Mother of Unsullied.

582
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,874
You're the Mother of Dragons.

583
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:14,422
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

584
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:18,296
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

585
00:39:18,297 --> 00:39:20,756
For all I know, he's flown halfway
across the world.

586
00:39:25,714 --> 00:39:27,839
I can't control them anymore.

587
00:39:29,256 --> 00:39:32,796
A dragon queen with no dragons

588
00:39:32,797 --> 00:39:33,922
is not a queen.

589
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:42,631
Viserion?

590
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:46,506
Rhaegal?

591
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:56,797
(snarling)

592
00:40:58,506 --> 00:41:00,046
Easy. Easy.

593
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:02,213
Easy.

594
00:41:02,214 --> 00:41:03,714
(roaring)

595
00:41:12,964 --> 00:41:15,506
<i>(roaring continues)</i>

596
00:41:30,464 --> 00:41:31,964
<i>(door opens)</i>

597
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:43,838
So here we are.

598
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:44,922
Here we are.

599
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,505
When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

600
00:41:51,506 --> 00:41:53,714
And now, for our last meeting...

601
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:59,505
This doesn't have to be
our last meeting.

602
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:01,922
No, but it will be.

603
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:06,796
You know what Stannis wants?

604
00:42:06,797 --> 00:42:09,338
He wants me to bend the knee.

605
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:11,713
And he wants the free folk
to fight for him.

606
00:42:11,714 --> 00:42:14,921
I'll give him this much,

607
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:16,255
he's bold.

608
00:42:16,256 --> 00:42:17,796
Shouldn't a king be bold?

609
00:42:17,797 --> 00:42:19,880
<i>Oh, aye.</i>

610
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:23,005
I respect him.

611
00:42:23,006 --> 00:42:24,546
If he gets what he wants,

612
00:42:24,547 --> 00:42:26,255
I expect he'll be a better ruler
than the fools

613
00:42:26,256 --> 00:42:30,171
sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

614
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,631
But I'll never serve him.

615
00:42:33,881 --> 00:42:35,671
You told me you weren't
here to conquer.

616
00:42:35,672 --> 00:42:37,005
You told me your people
have bled enough.

617
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:38,630
That's right.

618
00:42:38,631 --> 00:42:41,921
I don't want them bleeding for
Stannis Baratheon either.

619
00:42:41,922 --> 00:42:45,380
You spent your life convincing
90 clans to come together

620
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:46,463
for the first time in history.

621
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:49,630
Thenns and Hornfoots,

622
00:42:49,631 --> 00:42:52,713
the ice-river clans,
even the giants.

623
00:42:52,714 --> 00:42:55,713
A life's work uniting them.
You didn't do it for power.

624
00:42:55,714 --> 00:42:59,088
You didn't do it for glory.

625
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:01,255
You brought them
together to save them

626
00:43:01,256 --> 00:43:02,796
<i>because none of them</i>
<i>will survive the winter,</i>

627
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:04,671
<i>not if they're north</i>
<i>of the Wall.</i>

628
00:43:04,672 --> 00:43:06,671
Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

629
00:43:06,672 --> 00:43:08,506
Pride?

630
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:13,214
Fuck my pride.

631
00:43:14,506 --> 00:43:16,797
This isn't about that.

632
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,922
Then bend the knee
and save your people.

633
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:28,046
They followed me
because they respected me.

634
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:30,005
Because they believed in me.

635
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:32,380
The moment I kneel
for a southern king, that's all gone.

636
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:35,671
And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?

637
00:43:35,672 --> 00:43:38,921
How many women?
How many children?

638
00:43:38,922 --> 00:43:41,963
And you won't go out and rescue
them because why?

639
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:44,171
You're afraid of looking afraid.

640
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:47,006
Oh, I am afraid.

641
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:49,797
No shame in that.

642
00:43:59,172 --> 00:44:03,088
How will they do it?
Beheading?

643
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:04,964
Hanging?

644
00:44:07,672 --> 00:44:10,256
They'll burn you alive.

645
00:44:14,922 --> 00:44:16,714
Bad way to go.

646
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:22,671
I'll be honest with you.

647
00:44:22,672 --> 00:44:24,671
I don't want to die.

648
00:44:24,672 --> 00:44:26,838
And burnt to death,

649
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:28,796
I don't want people
to remember me like that,

650
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:30,671
scorched and screaming.

651
00:44:30,672 --> 00:44:33,463
But it's better than betraying

652
00:44:33,464 --> 00:44:35,171
everything I believe.

653
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,630
And what happens to your people?

654
00:44:37,631 --> 00:44:41,380
You preserve your dignity
and die standing

655
00:44:41,381 --> 00:44:43,796
and they'll sing
songs about you.

656
00:44:43,797 --> 00:44:45,255
You'd rather burn than kneel.

657
00:44:45,256 --> 00:44:46,922
The great hero.

658
00:44:49,756 --> 00:44:52,630
Until winter comes and
the white walkers come for us all

659
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:55,297
and there's no one left to sing.

660
00:44:57,714 --> 00:44:59,296
You're a good lad.

661
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:02,463
Truly you are.

662
00:45:02,464 --> 00:45:07,505
But if you can't understand why I won't
enlist my people

663
00:45:07,506 --> 00:45:10,255
in a foreigner's war,

664
00:45:10,256 --> 00:45:12,256
there's no point explaining.

665
00:45:20,756 --> 00:45:22,089
<i>(pounds on door)</i>

666
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:30,838
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.

667
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,671
(chuckles)

668
00:45:32,672 --> 00:45:35,213
The freedom to make
my own mistakes

669
00:45:35,214 --> 00:45:36,881
was all I ever wanted.

670
00:45:47,256 --> 00:45:49,338
<i>(door closes)</i>

671
00:45:49,339 --> 00:45:50,922
<i>(latch clanks)</i>

672
00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:50,213
Mance Rayder, you've been called
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

673
00:46:50,214 --> 00:46:52,963
Westeros only has one king.

674
00:46:52,964 --> 00:46:55,297
Bend the knee,
I promise you mercy.

675
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,964
Kneel and live.

676
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:22,131
This was my home for many years.

677
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:25,463
I wish you good fortune

678
00:47:25,464 --> 00:47:28,131
in the wars to come.

679
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:12,546
We all must choose.

680
00:48:12,547 --> 00:48:17,130
Man or woman, young or old,

681
00:48:17,131 --> 00:48:20,546
lord or peasant,
our choices are the same.

682
00:48:20,547 --> 00:48:24,046
We choose light
or we choose darkness.

683
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:27,088
<i>We choose good</i>
<i>or we choose evil.</i>

684
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:31,797
We choose the true god
or the false.

685
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:44,671
Free folk,

686
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:47,088
<i>there is only one true king</i>

687
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:50,213
<i>and his name is Stannis.</i>

688
00:48:50,214 --> 00:48:52,671
Here stands your king of lies.

689
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:55,797
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.

690
00:49:47,214 --> 00:49:50,756
(gasping)

691
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:12,338
<i>(Mance crying out)</i>

692
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:15,547
<i>(coughing)</i>

693
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:26,672
<i>(Mance crying out)</i>

694
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:29,881
(groaning stops)

695
00:50:34,547 --> 00:50:37,256
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>
