00:00:00,978 --> 00:00:02,679
Cersei:
<i>Myrcella is my only daughter.</i>

2
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:05,215
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

3
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:07,184
Dorne is the safest
place for her.

4
00:00:07,218 --> 00:00:10,019
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

5
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:13,489
( Groans )

6
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:17,927
No, wait.
It wasn't her.

7
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:19,995
( Grunts )

8
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:23,898
- ( Wailing )
- You can't avenge him if you're dead.

9
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:27,368
On behalf of the warlocks
of Qarth, I welcome you.

10
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,136
( Crowd gasps )

11
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:32,039
It would be an honor to host you
at the House of the Undying,

12
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,208
Mother of Dragons.

13
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,378
Littlefinger: <i>Stannis will be here</i>
<i>in an hour.</i>

14
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,180
Renly's bannermen
will flock to him.

15
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:40,082
Calling yourself king
doesn't make you one.

16
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:42,818
And if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

17
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:46,121
- Do you want to be a queen?
- I want to be <i>the</i> queen.

18
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:47,790
There on that mountain.

19
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:50,393
We need to get rid
of those lookouts.

20
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:52,628
I need to move fast
and silent.

21
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:54,964
Lord Commander,
I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

22
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:56,232
Aye.

23
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:57,734
Are you going
to kill Joffrey?

24
00:00:57,768 --> 00:00:59,836
- If the Gods give me strength.
- And then what?

25
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,704
First we have to
win the war.

26
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:03,540
You never told me
where you're from.

27
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:05,108
<i>Volantis.</i>

28
00:01:05,142 --> 00:01:07,310
You're one of them now.
I should have let you burn.

29
00:01:07,345 --> 00:01:09,345
You saved me
and the two I was with.

30
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,214
You stole three deaths
from the Red God.

31
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:13,416
- Speak three names.
- I can name anyone?

32
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,685
- <i>And you'll kill him?</i>
- A man has said.

33
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,220
Arya: <i>The one who tortures everyone.</i>
<i>They call him the Tickler.</i>

34
00:01:20,023 --> 00:01:22,290
Theon: The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

35
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:24,826
More impressive prize than
a few fisherman's daughters.

36
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,228
Soon as Winterfell got word that
we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

37
00:01:27,262 --> 00:01:29,597
the Starks would send
their men to take it back.

38
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,599
Take me to my ship.

39
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:34,302
Lord Stark, Torrhen's Square
is under siege.

40
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:36,638
Torrhen's Square is barely
40 leagues from here.

41
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:38,473
Go, Ser Rodrik.
Take the men you need.

42
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:40,008
Osha: <i>What did you see</i>
<i>in your dream?</i>

43
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:41,477
That the sea came
to Winterfell.

44
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:43,313
<i>Drowned men were</i>
<i>floating in the yard.</i>

I sent men over the walls

- Why?
- To take the castle.

- You went with Robb.
- And he sent me back to Pyke.

I won't.
I'll never yield.

All of you should do

My father has donned the
ancient crown of salt and rock

King of the Iron Islands.

You are all his subjects.

Bugger that.
I serve the Starks.

of my victory here

105

and one to Deepwood Motte
to my sister.

106

Inform her that she's
to bring 500 men to Winterfell.

sworn to serve the lord

I am.

I am the Lord

112
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,535
as Bran just informed you.

113
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:11,173

My Lord Greyjoy.

116
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:23,687
I see you've finally learned
how to address your betters.

117
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:25,256
What do you want?

118
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,558
I was brought here
a captive.

119
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:29,961
You were here the day
I was taken.

120
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:33,965
I'm the one who took you.
What of it?

121
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:36,701
Let me serve you.

122

Theon:
<i>Serve me how?</i>

123
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,839
I need fighters,
not kitchen sluts.

124
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:44,875
It was Robb Stark who
put me in the kitchens.

125
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,445
Put a spear
in my hand again.

126
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,547
So you can bury it
in my neck?

127
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:51,149
Do you take me
for a fool?

128
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:52,617
Get up.

129
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:55,720
Step aside.

130
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:58,022
Why?

131
00:07:58,057 --> 00:08:01,493
It's your dream,
little Lord.

132
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:04,964
The ocean has come
to swallow this place.

133
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:07,934
I ain't letting it
drown me.

134
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:10,770
- And in a few days' time--
- Rodrik: <i>Greyjoy!</i>

<i>done to him?</i>

00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:20,980
We caught this one on this way
back from Torrhen's Square.

137
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:23,949
Took out two of ours
before I got his sword.

138
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:27,419
Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that
we meet as foes.

139
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:31,290
It grieves me you've less honor
than a back alley whore.

140
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:34,793
You were raised here
under this roof.

141
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:37,496
- These people are your people.
- They are not my people.

142
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:39,732
King Robb thought of you
as a brother.

143
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:42,702
My brothers are dead.

144
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:45,505
They died fighting
Stark men, men like you.

145
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:48,975
Aye, they died fighting
a war your father started.

146
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:51,244
Lord Stark raised you
among his own sons.

147
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:53,412
Among them,
but not one of them.

148
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:56,248
I was his hostage
taken from my home.

149
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:57,983
If he were alive
to see this--

150
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,852
He's not.
He's dead.

151
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:01,954
The Seven Kingdoms
are at war.

152
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:04,256
And Winterfell is mine.

153
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,959
I should have put
a sword in your belly

154
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:08,527
instead of
in your hand.

155
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:11,663
You've served this House
faithfully, old man.

156
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:13,766
But keep talking
and I'll--

157
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,601
( grunts )

158
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:18,604
Take him to the cells.
Lock him up--

159
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,340
My prince,

160
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:22,942
you cannot let that stand.
He must pay.

161
00:09:22,977 --> 00:09:24,877
I'll lock him in a cell
until he rots--

162
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:27,914
No, he has to pay
the iron price.

163
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:31,051
They'll never respect
you while he lives.

164
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:46,068
<i>( Thunder rumbles )</i>

165
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:51,574
Ser Rodrik,

166
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:53,042
I sentence you to death.

167
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:55,544
No! You said no harm
would come to them if I yielded.

168
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:57,947
The old man couldn't
keep his mouth shut.

169
00:09:57,981 --> 00:10:00,649
I urge you not to make
a hasty decision.

170
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,653
He disrespected me
in front of my men.

171
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,154
That was his decision,
not mine.

172
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,656
He is worth more
to you alive than dead.

173
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:10,993
The Starks will pay.

174
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,863
Please, Theon,

175
00:10:13,897 --> 00:10:15,831
think what you do.

176
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:28,375
You'll address me
as Prince Theon

177
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,310
or you'll be next.

178
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:32,312
Come.

179
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,748
No!

180
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:37,984
- No!
- Bran: <i>Theon!</i>

181
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:40,921
Please!

182
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:42,823
Ser Rodrik!

183
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:45,693
He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

184
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:48,496
- Bran: <i>I'm begging you!</i>
- Coward.

185
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:54,368
Stop! Stop right now!

186
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,137
You don't give commands anymore,
little Lord.

187
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:58,839
- Please, stop this. Please stop him.
- Rodrik: <i>Hush now, child.</i>

188
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:01,976
I'm off to see your father.

189
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:06,981
Bran: You said no harm
would come!

190
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:09,750
<i>You said no harm would come.</i>
<i>Theon, please.</i>

191
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:12,587
Any last words, old man?

192
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:15,523
Gods help you,
Theon Greyjoy.

193
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:17,658
Now you are truly lost.

194
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:20,128
Bran:
<i>Theon, please, don't.</i>

195
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:23,264
- Rickon: <i>Do something.</i>
- Bran: <i>I'll do anything. Please!</i>

196
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:24,933
Rickon:
<i>No, please, stop it!</i>

197
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,534
- ( Grunts )
- ( Screams )

198
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:39,314
- <i>( Bran wailing )</i>
- <i>( Thunder rumbling )</i>

199
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,352
( Panting )

200
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:50,259
( Wind howling )

201
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:58,769
Jon:
Ghost, stay with us.

202
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:00,870
Ghost!

203
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:02,539
There goes your pet.

204
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:04,140
Jon:
<i>He's not a pet.</i>

205
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:06,676
Qhorin: <i>You're right,</i>
<i>he's not.</i>

206
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,279
You can't tame
a wild thing.

207
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,080
You can't trust
a wild thing.

208
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:14,150
- Ghost is different.
- So you think.

209
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:16,552
Wild creatures
have their own rules,

210
00:12:16,587 --> 00:12:18,754
their own reasons.

211
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:20,757
And you'll never
know them.

212
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:24,460
Now the wildlings
we're looking for

213
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,896
sleep during the day
and hunt at night.

214
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,901
I thought you said
you couldn't know wild things.

215
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:33,836
I said you can't.

216
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,906
They find a nice cave
to hide in while the sun's up

217
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,874
and do their killing
when it's dark.

218
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:41,944
- We could do the same.
- No, we couldn't.

219
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:44,180
This is their country.

220
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:47,250
They know where to walk,
where not to walk.

221
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:49,186
I've lost good men
who fell into a crevasse

222
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,355
they didn't see
till they were in it.

223
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,959
My father always said
I'm of the North.

224
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:56,760
( Chuckles )

225
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:59,663
- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.

226
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:02,933
This look like
home to you?

227
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:06,170
You start thinking
you know this place, it'll kill you.

228
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:09,506
You understand me?

229
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,975
No, you don't.

230
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,943
We're at war.

231
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:15,645
We've always been at war.

232
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,214
It's never going to end 'cause
we're not fighting an enemy.

233
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:21,818
We're fighting the North
and it's not going anywhere.

234
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,854
The Watch has given
you a great gift.

235
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,423
You only have one thing
to give in return--

236
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,891
your life.

237
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:30,259
I'll gladly give my life.

238
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:32,661
I don't want you
to be glad about it.

239
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:34,696
I want you to curse
and fight

240
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,165
until your heart's
done pumping.

241
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,635
And know this, boy--

242
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:43,371
your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.

243
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,606
They'll never know
what you've done.

244
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,141
They'll never know
how you died.

245
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:49,276
They won't even
know your damn name,

246
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,212
but they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

247
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:55,883
north of the Wall
gave his life for theirs.

248
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:59,052
Now, do you understand me?

249
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,821
I do.

250
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:03,223
You're even dumber
than you look.

251
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,493
It's just words, boy,

252
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:08,495
to keep us a little
warmer in the night,

253
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:11,766
make us feel like
we've got a purpose.

254
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,235
( Laughs )
Come on.

255
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:16,604
We've got to find these
goat fuckers before night falls

256
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,218
and they find us.

257
00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:32,456
- Can you read?
- My Lord?

258
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:35,526
Can you read?

259
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:41,598
This letter detailing
our infantry movements

260
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:44,301
was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.

261
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:48,139
It was sent to Lord Marlyn
of House Dormand.

262
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:50,174
My apologies, My Lord.
I must have--

263
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:53,745
Girl, fetch me the "History of the
Greater and the Lesser Houses."

264
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:56,548
It's the one on the--
( Chuckles )

265
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,521
My cupbearer can read
better than you.

266
00:15:11,731 --> 00:15:14,900
To whom does House Dormand
owe allegiance?

267
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,337
My Lord, I--

268
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:22,174
To the Starks
of Winterfell!

269
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:26,411
Who have 20,000 men
and my son!

270
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,948
I judged you might be
good for something more

271
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:32,550
than brutalizing peasants.

272
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:34,952
I see I overestimated you.

273
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:39,824
<i>If you ever put my son's</i>
<i>life at risk again, I'll...</i>

274
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:42,359
Leave us.

275
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:51,768
Put the book away, girl.

00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:02,278
Maybe you should devise our next
battle plan while you're about it.

282
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,456
Give us the room.

283
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:22,967
Clear all this.

00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:28,907
- Lord Tywin.
- Baelish.

- Wine?
- Thank you.

286
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:44,588
What news
from the capital?

287
00:16:44,622 --> 00:16:48,024
I travelled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

288
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,226
Ah, the late king Renly.

289
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,462
Rather a short reign.

290
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:54,498
Murdered by a woman,
I hear.

291
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:56,467
So they say.

292
00:16:56,501 --> 00:17:01,640
There has been talk
of other forces at work,

293
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:04,109
dark forces.

294
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:06,546
Here.

295
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:10,951
( Scoffs )
Men love to blame demons

296
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:14,721
when their grand plans
unravel.

297
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:17,557
It is my belief
that a moment of chaos

298
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:19,993
affords opportunities
lost soon after.

299
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:23,163
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

300
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:26,332
Yes, a crisis
is an opportunity.

301
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:28,834
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

302
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:30,569
After the Lannisters
and the Starks,

303
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:33,038
the Tyrells command
the largest host.

304
00:17:33,073 --> 00:17:35,208
Their lands are the most
fertile in the Seven Kingdoms,

305
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:39,178
- feeding horses and soldiers.
- Yes, yes, yes.

306
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:43,617
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

307
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:46,821
Loras wants revenge. He blames
Stannis for Renly's death.

308
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,524
And Margaery--

309
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:51,327
Wants to be queen.

310
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,162
Yes, she does.

311
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:59,235
House Tyrell rebelled
against the Iron Throne,

312
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:02,839
- against my grandson.
- They did.

313
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,208
And perhaps that treason
should be punished

<i>one day,</i>

after Stannis and Robb Stark
are defeated.

316
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,752
More wine for Lord Baelish.

317
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:25,128
If you will allow me to represent
your family's interests,

318

I believe that an advantageous
agreement--

319
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:30,332
The Tyrell host has
returned to Highgarden?

320
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,534
They have.

321
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,469
Pardon, My Lord.

322
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:36,438
It's only wine.

323
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:39,941
You would ride
there yourself?

324
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:41,876
Tonight, with your leave.

325
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,144
I'll have an answer
by nightfall.

326
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:45,846
That'll be all, girl.

327
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:52,987
What else?

328
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:55,155
On your son
Tyrion's directive,

329
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,691
I met with Catelyn Stark.

330
00:18:57,726 --> 00:18:59,226
Why?

331
00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:01,763
Littlefinger: <i>He had an interesting</i>
<i>proposal for her</i>

332
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:05,000
- concerning her daughters.
- Hmm.

333

- ( Groans )
- ( Shouting )

334
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:57,419
- A girl.
- A wildling.

335
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,855
We could question her.

336
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:01,857
You could.

337
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:03,492
She won't answer.

338
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:06,996
I've known a wildling to bite off
his tongue instead of talking.

339
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:11,233
- What's your name?
- Ygritte.

340
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:14,336
She was reaching for this axe
when you got to her.

341
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:18,107
Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.

342
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:20,943
I gave you my name.

343
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:24,713
I'm Jon Snow.

344
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,121
You ought to burn
them you killed.

345
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:35,824
Qhorin: <i>We'd need a big</i>
<i>fire for that.</i>

346
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:39,862
Tell me, Ygritte,

347
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:41,931
why do you want us
to build a big fire?

348
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:45,202
Are there some more
friends in the area?

349
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:48,572
Burn them or maybe you'll
need those swords again.

350
00:20:48,607 --> 00:20:51,142
Our boy here's already
killed one dead man.

351
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:53,577
He can do it again
if he has to.

352
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:56,179
What waits
beyond the pass?

353
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,248
- The free folk.
- How many?

354

( Chuckles )

355
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:02,118
Hundreds and thousands.

356
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:04,688
More than you've
ever seen, crow.

357
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:08,124
Why come to the mountains?

358
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,095
What's in the Frostfangs
your king could want?

359
00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:21,039
Do you mean to march
on the Wall?

360
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:29,282
Do you know
who I am, girl?

361
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:31,818
Qhorin Halfhand.

362
00:21:31,852 --> 00:21:33,352
Tell me true.

363
00:21:33,387 --> 00:21:36,656
If your people captured me,

364
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,658
would they take me prisoner?

365
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:40,860
They'd take your head
off your shoulders

366
00:21:40,894 --> 00:21:42,996
if they was feeling kind.

367
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,632
If not,
they'd kill you slow.

368

( Sighs )

369
00:21:48,302 --> 00:21:50,670
We have no food for her.

370
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:53,038
Can't spare a man
to watch her.

371
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:56,308
Can't let her go. She'll bring
Mance Rayder's army down on us.

372
00:21:56,342 --> 00:21:58,276
It needs to be done.

- Want me to do it?
- No.

374

No, I'll do it.

375
00:22:04,816 --> 00:22:06,883
Come, brothers.

376
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:09,018
We'll leave him to it.

377
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:11,053
We'll meet you
at the top.

378
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:12,589
Don't take too long.

379
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,257

You don't need
to do it.

Mance would take you.
I know he would.

There's secret ways.

The crows would
never catch us.

I'm as much a crow
as they are.

387

Will you burn me...

after?

389
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,174
Can't.

390
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,676
Someone might
see the smoke.

391

Strike hard and true,

Do it.

Traitors!

474
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:16,779
I'll have
all their heads.

475
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:18,647
Oh, you blind,
bloody fool.

476
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:20,616
You can't insult me.

477
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,518
We've had vicious kings
and we've had idiot kings,

478
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,356
but I don't know if
we've ever been cursed with

479
00:29:25,381 --> 00:29:26,488
a vicious idiot for a king.

480
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:28,256
- You can't--
- I can, I am.

481
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,791
They attacked me!

482
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:33,328
They threw a cow pie at you,
so you decided to kill them all?

483
00:29:33,362 --> 00:29:35,131
They're starving,
you fool.

484
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:36,999
All because of a war
you started.

485
00:29:37,034 --> 00:29:39,535
You're talking to a king!
( Shrieks )

486
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,805
And now I've struck a king.

487
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,007
Did my hand fall
from my wrist?

488
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:46,043
Where is the Stark girl?

489
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,612
Let them have her.

490
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:51,082
If she dies, you'll never
get your Uncle Jaime back.

491
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:53,952
You owe him quite a bit,
you know.

492
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:57,121
( Panting )

493
00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:04,329
- Where are you going?
- ( Cloth rips )

494
00:30:04,364 --> 00:30:08,133
- ( Laughing )
- You ever been fucked, little girl?

495
00:30:08,168 --> 00:30:11,470
- ( Whimpering )
- Come here.

496
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:13,506
Take some men and go and find
the Stark girl.

497
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,474
I take my orders
from the king.

498
00:30:16,943 --> 00:30:19,212
Man:
<i>This way!</i>

499
00:30:19,246 --> 00:30:21,982
( Screaming )

500
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:27,355
( Sobbing )
Please!

501
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:29,156
No, no.

502
00:30:32,394 --> 00:30:34,761
( Screams )

503
00:30:36,564 --> 00:30:38,097
( Choking )

504
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:40,199
( Grunts )

505
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:45,871
( Grunts )

506
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:48,273
( Sansa breathing heavily )

507
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:49,874
Please!

508
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:54,579
You're all right now,
little bird.

509
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:56,548
You're all right.

510
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,054
( Crowd shouting )

511
00:31:02,088 --> 00:31:04,056
( Screams )

512
00:31:09,964 --> 00:31:13,967
- Man: <i>We'll get you. We'll get you.</i>
- Man #2: <i>This way.</i>

513
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,570
Are you hurt,
My Lady?

514
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:19,238
The little bird's
bleeding.

515
00:31:19,273 --> 00:31:21,006
Someone take her back
to her cage,

516
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,908
<i>see to that cut.</i>

517
00:31:22,942 --> 00:31:24,476
Well done, Clegane.

518
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:27,479
I didn't do it for you.

519
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:31,215
He shouldn't
make me wait.

520
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:35,720
The Spice King is the second
wealthiest man in Qarth.

521
00:31:35,754 --> 00:31:37,888
He makes everyone wait.

522
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:41,158
Of course, you could have
avoided this embarrassment

523
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:43,661
if you married
the wealthiest man in Qarth.

524
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:45,730
I already have a husband.

525
00:31:45,764 --> 00:31:48,099
Khal Drogo is gone,
Khaleesi.

526
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:52,003
You are far too young
to be a widow forever

527
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:54,339
and far too beautiful.

528
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:56,141
And you are far too smart

529
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:59,644
to think that I will
succumb to flattery.

530
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,613
I have travelled
very far in my life

531
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:03,349
and met many women,

532
00:32:03,383 --> 00:32:05,184
but none that are
immune to flattery.

533
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:07,920
- <i>The Mother of Dragons!</i>
- Ah.

534
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:09,955
Here he comes.

535
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,592
Forgive me. I had terrible
dreams last night.

536
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:15,261
Terrible dreams.

537
00:32:15,295 --> 00:32:18,464
I could not sleep
until the sun was shining

538
00:32:18,498 --> 00:32:21,000
and the birds were singing.

539
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:23,769
<i>Look what a beauty you are</i>

540
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:26,371
<i>now the Red Waste</i>
<i>has been washed off you.</i>

541
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:29,741
I am sorry about
all that unpleasantness.

542
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:34,245
The silver hair
of a true Targaryen.

543
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,716
Xaro Xhoan Daxos,
she is far too lovely

544
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,286
for a glorified
dockworker like yourself.

545
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,856
Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,

546
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,958
who sold pepper
off the back of a wagon,

547
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:49,395
married a lady far lovelier
and higher born than himself.

548
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,663
Every lady alive
was lovelier

549
00:32:51,698 --> 00:32:53,932
and higher born
than my grandfather.

550
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:55,800
- ( Laughs )
- Daenerys: <i>Ahem.</i>

551
00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:59,370
Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?

552
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:01,339
I'll have them flogged
in the square.

553
00:33:01,373 --> 00:33:03,307
Thank you, My Lord.
You are a gracious host,

554
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:06,243
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

555
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:09,079
Oh, she has a talent
for drama, this one.

556
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:13,217
So, my little princess,
what is it you want?

557
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:14,685
My birthright--

558
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,621
the Seven Kingdoms
of Westeros.

559
00:33:16,655 --> 00:33:19,324
I fear I'm no better than
a servant in this regard.

560
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:21,426
I cannot give you
what I do not have.

561
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:24,063
I'm not asking you
for the Kingdoms.

562
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:25,865
I'm asking you
for ships.

563
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:27,534
I need to cross
the Narrow Sea.

564
00:33:27,568 --> 00:33:29,436
I need my ships as well.

565
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,937
I use them, you see,

566
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:33,440
to bring spices from
one port to another.

567
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:34,974
Whatever you grant me
now will be repaid

568
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:37,778
three times over when
I retake the Iron Throne.

569
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:39,246
Retake?

570
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,414
Did you once sit
on the Iron Throne?

571
00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:44,284
My father sat there
before he was murdered.

572
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:46,686
But if you did not
sit on it yourself,

573
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:50,157
would it not be correct
to say take the Iron Throne?

574
00:33:50,191 --> 00:33:52,225
I didn't come here
to argue grammar.

575
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:55,128
Of course not.
You came to take my ships.

576
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:57,730
So let me explain
my position,

577
00:33:57,765 --> 00:33:59,699
little princess.

578
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:03,202
Unlike you, I do not
have exalted ancestors.

579
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:05,205
I make my living by trade.

580
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:08,574
And I judge every trade
on its merits.

581
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:10,242
You ask for ships.

582
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:13,312
You say I shall be
repaid triple.

583
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:16,148
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

584
00:34:16,182 --> 00:34:18,417
But before you
repay your debts,

585
00:34:18,451 --> 00:34:21,052
you must seize
the Seven Kingdoms.

586
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:23,754
- Do you have an army?
- Not yet.

587
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:25,256
You do not have an army.

588
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,391
Do you have powerful
allies in Westeros?

589
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:29,560
There are many there
that support my claim.

590
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:31,062
When were you
there last?

591
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,698
I left when
I was a baby.

592
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:36,635
So, in truth,
you have no allies.

593
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,425
The people will rise
to fight for their rightful

594
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,140
Queen when I return.

595
00:34:41,141 --> 00:34:43,009
Ah.

596
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:44,811
Forgive me,
little princess,

597
00:34:44,845 --> 00:34:48,282
but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.

598
00:34:48,316 --> 00:34:49,783
Now if you'll pardon me.

599
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:52,519
Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?

600
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:55,189
Yes, we've met.
A shrewd man.

601
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:58,825
For my wedding he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.

602
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,728
<i>He believed--</i>
<i>the world believed--</i>

603
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:03,696
that the ages
had turned them to stone.

604
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:06,933
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

605
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:09,935
But I dreamt that
if I carried those eggs

606
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:12,438
into a great fire,
they would hatch.

607
00:35:12,472 --> 00:35:17,010
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

608
00:35:17,044 --> 00:35:19,212
But when the fire
burned out,

609
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:21,448
I was unhurt,

610
00:35:21,482 --> 00:35:24,318
the Mother of Dragons.

611
00:35:26,888 --> 00:35:29,156
Do you understand?

612
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:34,295
I'm no ordinary woman.

613
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:37,297
My dreams come true.

614
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,337
I admire your passion.

615
00:35:45,939 --> 00:35:49,242
But in business, I trust
in logic, not passion.

616
00:35:49,276 --> 00:35:50,943
I'm sorry, little princess.

617
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:53,312
I am not
your little princess.

618
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:56,382
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of old Valyria

619
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:58,418
and I will take
what is mine.

620
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:01,554
With fire and blood,
I will take it.

621
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:05,158
Yes, My Lady,
but not with my ships.

622
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:25,711
Who taught you to read?

623
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:28,013
My father, My Lord.

624
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:30,016
Hmm.

625
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,251
I taught my son
Jaime to read.

626
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:37,256
The Maester came
to me one day,

627
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,458
told me he wasn't learning.

628
00:36:39,493 --> 00:36:42,261
He couldn't make sense
of the letters.

629
00:36:42,296 --> 00:36:44,998
He reversed them
in his head.

630
00:36:45,032 --> 00:36:47,868
The Maester said he'd heard
tell of this affliction

631
00:36:47,902 --> 00:36:49,937
and that we simply
must accept it.

632
00:36:49,971 --> 00:36:52,039
Ha!

633
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:55,543
After that,
I sat Jaime down

634
00:36:55,578 --> 00:36:58,747
for four hours every day
until he learned.

635
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:03,986
He hated me for it,
for a time.

636
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,656
For a long time,

637
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,525
but he learned.

638
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:16,399
Where is your father?
Is he alive?

639
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:20,903
Who was he?

640
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:23,539
A stonemason.

641
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:25,873
A stonemason
who could read?

642
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:28,309
- Hmm.
- He taught himself.

643
00:37:28,343 --> 00:37:31,078
Quite a man.

644
00:37:32,113 --> 00:37:34,415
What killed him?

645
00:37:36,017 --> 00:37:38,151
Loyalty.

646
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:41,856
You're a sharp
little thing, aren't you?

647
00:37:45,227 --> 00:37:46,527
Did...

648
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,666
Forgive me, My Lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

649
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,936
No...

650
00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:57,873
But you've already begun.

651
00:37:57,907 --> 00:38:01,343
Did you know
your father, My Lord?

652
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:03,512
I did.

653
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:06,716
I grew up with him.

654
00:38:08,652 --> 00:38:11,588
I watched him
grow old.

655
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,861
<i>He loved us.</i>

656
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,697
He was a good man,

657
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:22,433
but a weak man,

658
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:25,970
a weak man who nearly destroyed
our House and name.

659
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,375
I'm cold.

660
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,111
I'll fetch more wood
for the fire, My Lord.

661
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,514
Mmm.

662
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:40,351
( Horse whinnies )

663
00:38:59,305 --> 00:39:01,940
( Grunts )

664
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:03,642
Where are you going, girl?

665
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:06,612
The armory,
My Lord.

666
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,248
Why?

667
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:10,116
Lord Tywin sent me.

668
00:39:12,086 --> 00:39:14,354
What might this be?

669
00:39:14,388 --> 00:39:17,290
Lord Tywin gave it to me.

670
00:39:17,324 --> 00:39:19,392
What for?

671
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:22,261
To take to the armory.

672
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:24,797
Why would he do that?

673
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:28,401
Let's go and ask him.

674
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:33,306
Move!

675
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:37,277
Get out of the way!

676
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:53,728
( Men chatting )

677
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:08,875
Amory Lorch.

678
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,910
A girl has named
a second name.

679
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:12,512
A man will do
what must be done.

680
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:14,481
Now!

681
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:18,385
A girl cannot tell a man when
exactly he must do a thing.

682
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,688
A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.

683
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:22,657
But he's going to tell Tywin.
He's getting away.

684
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:25,693
- It has to be now.
- ( Sighs )

685
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:34,969
Guard!

686
00:40:39,174 --> 00:40:41,643
<i>( Horse whinnies )</i>

687
00:40:44,246 --> 00:40:46,580
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

688
00:40:50,452 --> 00:40:52,986
My honor, Your Grace.

689
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:55,455
Your Grace.

690
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:03,062
- Your Grace.
- Quent.

691
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:25,886
Lady Talisa.

692
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:28,489
Your Grace.

693
00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:32,060
I'm not sure I'm a lady.

694
00:41:32,094 --> 00:41:34,228
Westerosi customs are still
a bit foreign to me.

695
00:41:34,263 --> 00:41:36,664
It's hard to keep
all the rules straight.

696
00:41:36,698 --> 00:41:39,800
But if I remember
my lessons,

697
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:42,369
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady

698
00:41:42,404 --> 00:41:44,904
unless she's a queen
or a princess.

699
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:47,139
I could find
someone who knows.

700
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:49,742
Why are you so sure
I'm of noble birth?

701
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:51,810
Because it's obvious.

702
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:55,480
What if I told you my father
sold lace on the long bridge

703
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:58,450
and my mother, my brother, and I lived
with him above our shop?

704
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:01,319
I'd call you a liar.

705
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:04,756
Not very noble to accuse
a lady of dishonesty.

706
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,895
I always thought
I was a brilliant liar.

707
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:14,298
Better at amputations,
I'm afraid.

708
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:20,971
Quite a pretty spot.

709
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,640
Will we be here long?

710
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,409
I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.

711
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,878
I'm not a spy.

712
00:42:28,912 --> 00:42:31,980
Of course a spy
would deny being a spy.

713
00:42:33,283 --> 00:42:35,818
You're right.
You've found me out.

714
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:37,586
I'm writing a letter
to the Lannisters.

715
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,056
"The Young Wolf
is on the move."

716
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,794
Perhaps you'd join me...

717
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:48,099
If you've got time,
of course, for, well...

718
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,435
Robb.

719
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,738
Mother.

720
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:02,380
Mother, this is
Lady Talisa.

721
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,682
She's been helping
with the wounded.

722
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:07,618
She's been very...
helpful.

723
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:09,186
Lady Talisa.

724
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,887
Lady Stark.

725
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,755
Lady Talisa...?

726
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,359
- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?

727
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:19,329
Forgive me,
I do not know this name.

728
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:22,433
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.

729
00:43:23,502 --> 00:43:26,638
Excuse me, My Lady.
Your Grace.

730
00:43:35,215 --> 00:43:36,883
I've missed you.

731
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:40,320
Yes, you look
positively forlorn.

732
00:43:40,354 --> 00:43:43,189
You surprised me,
that's all.

733
00:43:43,224 --> 00:43:46,393
I didn't think
I'd see you today.

734
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:48,795
I wish that you were free
to follow your heart.

735
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,263
I know.

736
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:52,966
You have inherited your
father's responsibilities.

737
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,802
I'm afraid they come
at a cost.

738
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:59,239
- I know.
- You are promised to another--

739
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:03,743
a debt that must be paid.

740
00:44:03,778 --> 00:44:06,146
- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace.

741
00:44:06,181 --> 00:44:09,917
My Lady.
News from Winterfell.

742
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:11,885
( Wind howling )

743
00:44:22,297 --> 00:44:25,099
Your brothers desert you?

744
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:27,367
I can tell you
which way to go.

745
00:44:27,402 --> 00:44:30,037
We'll stop here.

746
00:44:30,071 --> 00:44:32,039
Too dark to go
any farther today.

747
00:44:32,073 --> 00:44:34,975
Here? There's no
shelter here.

748
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,410
There's no shelter
anywhere.

749
00:44:36,444 --> 00:44:39,180
There is if you know
where to look.

750
00:44:42,617 --> 00:44:44,585
The cold
could kill us both.

751
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:46,620
- If you light a fire--
- No fire.

752
00:44:46,654 --> 00:44:49,456
- But a fire is--
- No fire.

753
00:44:52,093 --> 00:44:54,261
Have it your way.

754
00:45:01,169 --> 00:45:03,771
We'll stay warmer
if we stay close.

755
00:45:05,741 --> 00:45:08,309
Bet you freeze to death
before I do.

756
00:45:10,146 --> 00:45:12,581
Bet your life.

757
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,175
Think they're out
looking for you?

758
00:45:40,577 --> 00:45:43,346
- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?

759
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:45,582
Yes.

760
00:45:48,286 --> 00:45:50,320
You're brave.

761
00:45:51,356 --> 00:45:53,189
Stupid,

762
00:45:53,224 --> 00:45:55,125
but brave.

763
00:45:57,762 --> 00:46:01,031
We start again at first light.
Get some sleep.

764
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:18,848
Stop moving.

765
00:46:18,883 --> 00:46:22,553
I'm just trying
to get comfortable.

766
00:46:22,587 --> 00:46:24,455
Stop it!

767
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,370
- <i>You're still moving.</i>
- Was I?

768
00:46:39,404 --> 00:46:42,006
I didn't notice
that time.

769
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:54,818
This cannot be true.

770
00:46:54,852 --> 00:46:56,553
Bolton: <i>We've had ravens</i>
<i>from White Harbor,</i>

771
00:46:56,587 --> 00:46:58,789
Barrowton
and the Dreadfort.

772
00:46:58,823 --> 00:47:00,824
I'm afraid it is true.

773
00:47:01,726 --> 00:47:03,627
Why?
Why would Theon--

774
00:47:03,662 --> 00:47:05,897
Because the Greyjoys
are treasonous whores.

775
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:08,600
- <i>My brothers?</i>
- We've heard nothing of them.

776
00:47:08,634 --> 00:47:10,535
( Sighs )

777
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,872
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

778
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:17,576
I told you,
never trust a Greyjoy!

779
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:22,715
I must go North at once.

780
00:47:22,749 --> 00:47:24,884
There's still a war
to win, Your Grace.

781
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:27,386
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

782
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,922
How can I ask men
to follow me if I can't--

783
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,656
You are a king.

784
00:47:30,657 --> 00:47:33,492
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

785
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:35,328
Let me go
and talk to Theon.

786
00:47:35,362 --> 00:47:38,265
There will be no talk.
He will die for this.

787
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:41,568
Theon holds the castle
with a skeleton crew.

788
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:43,937
Let me send word to
my bastard at the Dreadfort.

789
00:47:43,971 --> 00:47:48,175
He can raise a few hundred men and
retake Winterfell before the new moon.

790
00:47:48,209 --> 00:47:51,311
We have the Lannisters
on the run.

791
00:47:51,346 --> 00:47:55,983
If you march all the way back north
now, you'll lose what you gained.

792
00:47:56,017 --> 00:47:59,654
My boy would be honored to
bring you Prince Theon's head.

793
00:47:59,688 --> 00:48:04,292
Tell your son Bran and Rickon's
safety is paramount.

794
00:48:04,326 --> 00:48:07,328
And Theon-- I want him
brought to me alive.

795
00:48:08,864 --> 00:48:11,332
I want to look him
in the eye and ask him why.

796
00:48:11,367 --> 00:48:13,968
And then I'll take
his head myself.

797
00:48:14,003 --> 00:48:17,872
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

798
00:48:17,906 --> 00:48:19,807
I'm no liar.

799
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:22,877
All wildlings
are liars and savages

800
00:48:22,911 --> 00:48:24,746
with no loyalty
to anything or anyone.

801
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,115
I done what I had
to do to stay alive.

802
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:30,018
I hate the Starks
as well as you do.

803
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:33,355
Let me serve you,
My Lord.

804
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,192
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

805
00:48:36,226 --> 00:48:38,694
There are other ways
to serve, My Lord.

806
00:48:38,728 --> 00:48:41,263
I'm a prince now,
and you'd do well--

807
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:44,200
There are other ways
to serve, my prince.

808
00:48:44,235 --> 00:48:46,736
( Chuckles )

809
00:48:48,673 --> 00:48:50,308
Like what?

810
00:48:52,844 --> 00:48:55,647
We know things,
the free people.

811
00:48:55,681 --> 00:48:58,249
You know things?

812
00:48:58,284 --> 00:49:00,185
Like what?

813
00:49:00,219 --> 00:49:02,487
How to eat dirt?
( Laughs )

814
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:05,523
( Scoffs )
Other things.

815
00:49:06,692 --> 00:49:09,293
Savage things.

816
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:13,130
Wait outside.

817
00:49:30,046 --> 00:49:32,248
I always wondered
what you had under there.

818
00:49:32,282 --> 00:49:35,284
It comes at a price.

819
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:37,586
I'm not killing you.
That's your price.

820
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:39,188
I already had that.

821
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:42,191
What do you want, then,

822
00:49:42,225 --> 00:49:44,827
other than
your miserable life?

823
00:49:44,861 --> 00:49:46,963
What all free people want--

824
00:49:46,997 --> 00:49:49,132
my freedom.

825
00:49:54,004 --> 00:49:55,873
Well, you shall
have it, then.

826
00:49:58,142 --> 00:50:00,744
But only if you
serve me well.

827
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:08,552
- Ow.
- Shh.

828
00:50:08,586 --> 00:50:11,655
- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.

829
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:13,223
They thought so, too.

830
00:50:13,257 --> 00:50:15,893
He hated me,
the man who hit me.

831
00:50:15,927 --> 00:50:18,495
I saw it in his eyes.
Hated me.

832
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,330
He never met me before,

833
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:23,333
but he wanted
to hurt me.

834
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:26,403
- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger--

835
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:28,705
You are everything
he will never have.

836
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:30,874
Your horse eats better
than his children.

837
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:34,244
It doesn't matter now.
He's dead.

838
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:37,147
I would have given them
bread if I had it.

839
00:50:37,182 --> 00:50:39,783
I hate the King
more than any of them.

840
00:50:39,818 --> 00:50:41,652
Don't say these things.

841
00:50:41,686 --> 00:50:42,953
If the wrong
people hear you--

842
00:50:42,987 --> 00:50:45,289
But you're not
the wrong people.

843
00:50:50,695 --> 00:50:52,863
Don't trust anybody.

844
00:50:52,897 --> 00:50:55,465
Life is safer
that way.

845
00:51:23,863 --> 00:51:27,032
( Murmurs )

846
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:39,144
And where
are you going?

847
00:51:40,379 --> 00:51:42,948
I have something for you
from Prince Theon.

848
00:51:42,982 --> 00:51:45,817
- What?
- Me.

849
00:51:48,221 --> 00:51:51,023
He says I'm to make
the rounds.

850
00:51:57,164 --> 00:51:59,665
And keep you warm.

851
00:52:04,604 --> 00:52:07,206
( Groans )

852
00:52:10,076 --> 00:52:12,744
( Whistles )

853
00:52:21,855 --> 00:52:24,323
( Panting )

854
00:52:26,693 --> 00:52:30,029
The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

855
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,705
The Silk King won't support me

856
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,730
because of his business with
the Lannisters.

857
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,701
Why offend
his best customer?

858
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:39,104
And the Copper King
offers me a single ship

859
00:52:39,138 --> 00:52:42,507
on the condition that I lie
with him for a night.

860
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:45,509
Does he think I will
whore myself for a boat?

861
00:52:45,544 --> 00:52:49,045
When I came to this city,
I had nothing.

862
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,581
Truly nothing.

863
00:52:51,615 --> 00:52:53,683
I slept by the docks.

864
00:52:53,717 --> 00:52:56,452
And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.

865
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:59,522
If not,
I dreamed of food.

866
00:52:59,556 --> 00:53:02,558
Today I am the richest
man in Qarth.

867
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:05,027
Do you think the path
from poverty to wealth

868
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:07,429
is always pure
and honorable?

869
00:53:07,463 --> 00:53:11,099
I have done
many things, Khaleesi,

870
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:13,635
that a righteous man
would condemn.

871
00:53:13,669 --> 00:53:17,239
And here I am,
with no regrets.

872
00:53:30,088 --> 00:53:33,724
Bar the gates.
Ring the bells.

873
00:53:33,758 --> 00:53:36,426
Slowly, Khaleesi.

874
00:53:36,461 --> 00:53:38,595
- <i>( Bells tolling )</i>
- <i>( People shouting )</i>

875
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:48,136
<i>Where are they?</i>

876
00:53:54,544 --> 00:53:57,246
Where are my dragons?!

877
00:54:02,887 --> 00:54:05,622
<i>( Dragons screeching )</i>

878
00:54:25,243 --> 00:54:28,012
<i>( Theme music playing )</i>
