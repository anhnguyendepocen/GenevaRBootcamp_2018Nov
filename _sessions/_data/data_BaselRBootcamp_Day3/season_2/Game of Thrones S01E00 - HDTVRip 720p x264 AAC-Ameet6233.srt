1
00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:08,608


2
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:13,977
There is love and betrayal,
greed and murder.

3
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:21,716
It's set in this interesting
world of contrasting ideology,

4
00:00:21,836 --> 00:00:23,572
of what's right and wrong.

5
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:25,670
It has a great philosophy about it.

6
00:00:40,218 --> 00:00:47,940
"Game of Thrones" is about power struggles
in a fantasy kingdom, called Westeros.

7
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,763
And it's a power struggle
for the Iron Throne,

8
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:53,130
which is the seat of power
in this kingdom.

9
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,070
There's a war coming, Ned.

10
00:00:56,014 --> 00:01:00,092
I don't know when, I don't know who
would be fighting, but it's coming.

11
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:07,041
At the core of it there's a conflict for
power between two great houses initially.

12
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:10,038
House Stark and House Lannister.

13
00:01:10,158 --> 00:01:13,249
The other major houses are
all contenders as well.

14
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,106
It's a suitably complicated
political situation.

15
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,799
The old truth "the power corrupts",
I think

16
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:21,660
it's very valid and it
shows in this series.

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,588
You see characters come into
power and how they change.

18
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:28,860
In a way it's about how people
forget to see the bigger picture,

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,890
this common threat, that everybody
kind of ignores, because they're too busy

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,238
pursuing their own interests.

21
00:01:35,358 --> 00:01:40,225
And meanwhile, outside the Seven
Kingdoms, two great threats arising.

22
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:44,050
One across the sea, in the exile
Targaryen siblings,

23
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,386
and another far to the north,
beyond the Wall,

24
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:50,064
which is the boundary
of the Seven Kingdoms,

25
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:55,280
in lands of perpetual ice and cold,
where supernatural threat is stirring.

26
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:00,455
It's very different from
anything that's been done.

27
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:03,967
I can't think of another fantasy
which is as dark as this one is,

28
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:05,650
which is as gritty and as real.

29
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,175
Every single character
is incredibly complex.

30
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,326
You think you know them.

31
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:14,131
You think you got them pegged as what
they seemingly are but they really aren't.

32
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:17,659
Is there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

33
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:18,843
Yes.

34
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:21,269
The wiser answer was "no", my lord.

35
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,628
It's not a good guys/bad guys story.

36
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:26,400
It's a story where everybody is
pursuing their own interests

37
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,674
and everybody's following their own
code and it's about those interests

38
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:33,349
and those ethics coming into
conflict with each other.

39
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:37,575
And it provides a much richer story
than the guys in white

40
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:39,269
beating the guys in black.

41
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:42,250
Lord Baelish, perhaps
I was wrong to distrust you.

42
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,282
Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've
done since you climbed off your horse.

43
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:50,760
It's quite big sprawling epic story and...

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,732
and fascinating characters, different
characters, very rich, so tasty characters

45
00:02:56,852 --> 00:02:59,930
you don't know who they are
or how they fit in.

46
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:02,174
Surely we are here, my lord.

47
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:05,639
- There is no telling who has eyes as well.
- Let them look.

48
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,793
So I find it very dense
and multilayered.

49
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:13,256
That's what I find intriguing,
fascinating in this thing.

50
00:03:29,372 --> 00:03:33,538
Ned Stark is the center of the series.

51
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:37,030
It's very realistic,
quite pragmatic character.

52
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:38,123
This is fine work.

53
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:39,466
It's not for sale.

54
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:41,644
- His lordship wants the helmet.
- I made it for me.

55
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:43,719
Forgive him, my Lord.

56
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:45,342
There's nothing to forgive.

57
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:50,251
He's principled, he has values, and
above all he's very loyal, you know and...

58
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:54,629
that's something that he
demonstrates on many occasions.

59
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:57,947
You help me win the Iron Throne,
then help me keep the thing.

60
00:03:58,474 --> 00:04:00,985
We were meant to rule together.

61
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:02,991
Ned is the Lord of Winterfell.

62
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:05,484
And he is married to Catelyn Tully.

63
00:04:05,604 --> 00:04:08,781
Together they have a
number of children.

64
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:13,623
17 years ago you rode off with
Robert Baratheon,

65
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:18,345
you came back a year
later with another woman's son.

66
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:23,534
Jon Snow is of an age with Robb, the eldest
son, and they're closest brothers.

67
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:27,862
I would say Jon Snow is a
young hero in a lot of ways.

68
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:31,857
Well, lord Snow, it appears you're
the least useless person here.

69
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:34,946
Personally I think there's a
hell of a lot of inner turmoil

70
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:39,357
fighting between his ambition to be
someone and to make a mark on things.

71
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:40,816
I'm ready.

72
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:43,539
You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.

73
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:48,902
Here a man gets what he earns.
When you earn it.

74
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:53,286
His ambition can and does make
him do quite extreme things.

75
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:56,039
The Lannisters
are the Queen's family.

76
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,497
Robert Baratheon, the King, wed the daughter
of another great house, Cersei Lannister.

77
00:05:00,617 --> 00:05:02,734
She is the Queen of
the Seven Kingdoms.

78
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:06,171
She's quite tricky.
Layered. And power-mad.

79
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,680
She's smart and political and has
a hard time trusting anyone.

80
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,628
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

81
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:14,250
You take your orders
and you carry on.

82
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,913
I was also trained to kill
my enemies, your grace.

83
00:05:18,232 --> 00:05:19,314
As was I.

84
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:24,316
There is a definitive sense with Cersei
that *** fit *** will further her game of power

85
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:26,889
She'll get rid of anybody.
It doesn't really matter.

86
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:31,545
Jaime, her twin brother is one of
the members of the King's Guard.

87
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,342
It would be good to
have you on the field.

88
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:35,229
Ambition has become a bit stale.

89
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:36,965
I don't fight in tournaments.

90
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:39,232
I just wanna fight a man for real.

91
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:41,309
I don't want him to
know what I can do.

92
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:44,861
He is a soldier and he doesn't
care about the politics.

93
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:48,636
He knows the game and doesn't
want to be directly involved.

94
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:52,858
Cersei and Jaime also have
another brother, Tyrion Lannister.

95
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,861
Tyrion Lannister, because of his size,
has had a very complicated upbringing

96
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,311
in relation to
his father and his sister.

97
00:06:00,431 --> 00:06:04,797
He is very well-read, he has zero
powers with physical defenses.

98
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:08,471
So he has to defend himself
with his wit and charm.

99
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:10,550
Why do you read so much?

100
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,226
Look at me and tell me
what you see.

101
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:16,408
Is this a trick?

102
00:06:17,187 --> 00:06:19,334
What you see is a dwarf.

103
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:22,525
My brother has a sword
and I have my mind.

104
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:25,684
And a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

105
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:29,355
There's a set of characters
that you also encounter who are

106
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:31,781
crossed narrow sea and are
in an entirely different conflict.

107
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:33,965
May I present my honored guests?

108
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:36,906
Viserys of House Targaryen,

109
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:42,205
the rightful king of the Andals and
his sister Daenerys of House Targaryen.

110
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:44,459
He's the man on a mission.

111
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,616
He's fairly obsessive about one thing,
which is regaining his crown.

112
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:52,903
When they write the history of my reign,
sweet sister, they will say it began today.

113
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:56,761
He's very bitter, and resentful
to people who took it from him.

114
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:59,497
And he carries a huge burden.

115
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:02,215
His sister is a Daenerys Targaryen.

116
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,990
Also known as Daenerys Stormborn.

117
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,336
Tell them to stop.

118
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:08,193
You want the entire horde to stop?
For how long?

119
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:10,395
Until I command them otherwise.

120
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:11,727
She gives them such a journey.

121
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:14,154
She gets put up with a lot of
obstacles coming her way and

122
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:17,303
every time she overcomes them,
she succeeds and she kind of

123
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:19,099
gets stronger and stronger. She goes on.

124
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:21,504
She's an incredibly... incredibly
wicked person.

125
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:24,793
There are plots within plots
and wheels within wheels and

126
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:27,909
many people competing
for one seat.

127
00:07:44,457 --> 00:07:47,279
Going into this story it's been very
important to us

128
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:48,308
that things never look fake.

129
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:52,141
For us it's about creating a world and making
it an authentic and believable world,

130
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:53,379
but it's not our world.

131
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:59,165
We were lucky enough to have the help
of a tremendously gifted art department.

132
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:03,064
I'm responsible for
the look of the show.

133
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:05,707
From the colors of
the floor to the sky.

134
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:07,596
What now what we see
is going to be

135
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:09,958
the whole look of it
from there downwards so

136
00:08:10,078 --> 00:08:12,533
we have a complete
look to the series.

137
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:16,291
You have to create a world
from scratch that feels like

138
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:19,125
you're in a different time and
place so it's creating different

139
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,834
environments that work that
feel real but don't feel like

140
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:25,283
contemporary or known periods,
that's the main thing.

141
00:08:25,317 --> 00:08:28,758
The biggest challenges have been
I guess the scale of the event.

142
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:31,364
We've created very high
standards for ourselves.

143
00:08:31,484 --> 00:08:35,512
There are a lot of bits and a
lot of stuff to pull together.

144
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:38,567
Jenna Jackson really
range far and wide

145
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,552
to find the artistic resources
and the stylistic resources,

146
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:45,077
to give us a world
we haven't seen before.

147
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:48,076
There's an arctic wasteland,
which is very far north

148
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,036
and you go all the way to a
more desert wilderness

149
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,705
and everything in between.

150
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,684
Our brief was to try to combine

151
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:57,788
interesting visual elements

152
00:08:57,822 --> 00:09:00,393
from a lot of different
societies and periods.

153
00:09:00,513 --> 00:09:03,617
So we spend a lot of time
researching... medieval Europe,

154
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:07,116
we looked at oriental influences,
we looked at Asian influences,

155
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:10,029
we looked at subcontinent,
we looked at African influences.

156
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,489
We tried to find references
from a lot of different civilizations

157
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:15,873
and different times
and combine them.

158
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:19,361
You try to create a
world that's based in

159
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:21,427
real physics,
even if it's fantasy.

160
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:23,990
There has to be a reality to it.
To go forward we look just like a set

161
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,396
so always try to think...
How would these people live?

162
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,845
What would the need?
Why would they put things...

163
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:31,074
where they do?
How would it be?

164
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:34,106
I think the approach we
want to take is that yes,

165
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:36,300
it is fantasy but it's
very grounded in reality

166
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,751
and I think we want to make it
as real as possible.

167
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,915
And that's the same approach
we are taking with everything

168
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:43,362
and I think as the series goes on,
you'll see the great...

169
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,260
Differences between the four worlds
what the series inhabit.

170
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,637
It's very important to have
a complete different look,

171
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:51,027
and light be different
and the topography.

172
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,867
We've been given the luxury of
being able to span various countries.

173
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:58,170
So we've scouted probably,
I don't know, 14 different countries

174
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,093
when we were trying to
decide where to shoot

175
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,994
and why ultimately we decided
to shoot northern Ireland.

176
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:06,390
We drive 25 minutes and you're
at some beautiful forest somewhere.

177
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,998
And you drive 45 minutes and
you're at this great old castle.

178
00:10:09,545 --> 00:10:12,859
It's a huge scale shooting
simultaneously in two different countries.

179
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,707
Malta and Ireland. It`s a challenge,

180
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:16,694
but it's great fun.
We love it.

181
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:19,964
One of fun things about this show
that we get to make it up.

182
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:23,768
We're not cueing to any particular
historical period absolutely.

183
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:26,108
This a fantasy series
and it gives us a

184
00:10:26,228 --> 00:10:28,848
lot of freedom and
that's part of the fun of it.

185
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:30,684
Fantasy is always bigger.

186
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:33,467
I mean, fantasy is larger
and more colorful

187
00:10:33,587 --> 00:10:35,715
and more exciting than history.

188
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,551
So you take your inspiration from

189
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:41,221
something in history you make it
much bigger and perhaps more dramatic.

190
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,215
It's just the best story,
it's fascinating and

191
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:45,796
there are so many twists
and turns and

192
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,495
when you think you
have it figured it completely

193
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,313
it changes its mind.

194
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:53,835
You follow it and get excited by it.
This real emotion and this...

195
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:56,455
real relationships that you
can understand and relate.

196
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:58,579
It's just brilliant.
It's a wonderful story.

197
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,948
It's an interesting
combination of a very

198
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:03,695
real world with an
overlay of fantasy.

199
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:06,355
It's a pretty intriguing
combination, and I think

200
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:09,536
it's something that you see nowhere
else on television currently.

201
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:12,427
I don't think anybody will do it
quite the way HBO does.

202
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:17,698
What do you know about fear?

203
00:11:17,732 --> 00:11:19,866
Fear is for the winter.

204
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:22,736
when the snows fall
a hundred feet deep.

205
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,005
Fear is for the long night,

206
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,899
when the white walkers
rove through the woods.

207
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:31,941
When the sun hides for years.

208
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:37,550
And children are born and live
and die all in darkness.

209
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:43,369
That is the time for fear, my lord.
