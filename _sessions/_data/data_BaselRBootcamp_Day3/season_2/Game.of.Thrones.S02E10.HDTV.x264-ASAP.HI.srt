1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:02,336
Sam:
<i>The fist of the First Men.</i>

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,605
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men stood here.

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:06,674
They came here to get
away from something.

4
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:08,177
And I don't think it worked.

5
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:09,612
Your sword.

6
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:12,118
Man: <i>The Kingslayer,</i>
<i>he escaped in the night.</i>

7
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:12,915
How?

8
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,352
Jaime Lannister has
played you for a fool.

9
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:17,887
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

10
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:20,658
<i>Returning him may buy</i>
<i>life for my children.</i>

11
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:23,195
A girl owes one more name.
Give a man a name.

12
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:26,298
- Jaqen H'ghar.
- A girl gives a man his own name?

13
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:28,767
I'll un-name you if you help
me and my friends escape.

14
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:31,870
Jaqen: <i>A girl and her friends will</i>
<i>walk through the gate at midnight.</i>

15
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:35,274
Osha: <i>Who was that out there</i>
<i>hung up at the gates?</i>

16
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:37,509
Must have been
the farmer's boys.

17
00:00:37,543 --> 00:00:38,777
Osha:
<i>Killed them, burned them,</i>

18
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,879
<i>and passed them off</i>
<i>as the little lords?</i>

19
00:00:40,913 --> 00:00:43,381
Got as far as the farm
then doubled back.

20
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,017
Hoped this would be the last
place they'd think to look.

21
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:48,853
My bastard is only a few
days from Winterfell.

22
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:50,789
- Once he captures the castle--
- Theon has my brothers.

23
00:00:50,823 --> 00:00:53,825
- If we storm the castle--
- he wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

24
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,496
There is only hope of escaping
the North with his head.

25
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,964
Send word to your son.

26
00:00:57,998 --> 00:01:00,134
Any Ironborn
who surrender will be allowed

27
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:01,902
to return safely
to their homes.

28
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,271
With the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

29
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:07,441
I expect his countrymen will turn on
him the minute they hear the offer.

30
00:01:07,476 --> 00:01:09,444
Qhorin: Mance is gonna march
on the wall.

31
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:11,546
When he does,
one brother inside his army

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,214
will be worth 1,000
fighting against him.

33
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:15,149
- They'll never trust me.
- They might.

34
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:17,118
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

35
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:21,222
I should have known better,
trusting a traitor's bastard!

36
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,759
He's not yours
to kill, crow.

37
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,361
I don't want to marry
the Frey girl.

38
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:27,929
I don't want you
to marry her.

39
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,933
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

40
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,624
If my dragons are in
the House of the Undying,

41
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,430
then take me there.

42
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:36,972
That's what
the warlock wants.

43
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:40,476
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

44
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,512
They're coming ashore.
There are too many.

45
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:43,813
Rain fire on them.

46
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:45,582

47
00:01:56,362 --> 00:02:00,133

She remains innocent.

104

I would ask you to
find it in your heart

105

to do us the great honor
of joining our Houses.

Well, I too have heard tales

Your Grace, in the judgment
of your small council,

120
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:29,039
it would be neither
proper nor wise

121
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:32,609
for you to wed the daughter
of a man beheaded for treason,

122
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:35,111
a girl whose brother
is in open rebellion

your councilors
beg you...

You shouldn't say that.

You'll be good enough

And now that
you're a woman,

he'll be able to enjoy you

00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:42,371
He'll let you go home?

159
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:45,809
Joffrey's not the sort of boy
who gives away his toys.

160
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,745
You have a tender heart,

161
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,715
just like your mother
did at your age.

162
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:55,219
I can see so much
of her in you.

163
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:58,087
She was like
a sister to me.

164
00:10:58,122 --> 00:11:00,990
For her sake,

165
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:04,193
I'll help get you home.

166
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:09,730
King's Landing
is my home now.

167
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:13,167
Look around you.

168
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:16,336
We're all liars here.

169
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:19,640
And every one of us
is better than you.

170
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:25,946
<i>( Man laughing )</i>

171
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,884
- ( Door opens )
- ( Knocks )

172
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,287
Come in.

173
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:35,589
Make yourself
comfortable.

174
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:45,063
That doesn't look
very comfortable.

175
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:48,099
Here, watch me.

176
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,971
No need for that,
my dear.

177
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:55,440
You sure?

178
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:57,442
Most men like
what they see.

179
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:59,111
I'm not like
most men.

180
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:01,613
- <i>That's what most men say.</i>
- ( Laughs )

181
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:05,117
If you don't want
what most men want,

182
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:07,821
then you'd better tell me
what you'd like me to do.

183
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,860
I would like you to tell me
if working for Lord Baelish

184
00:12:12,894 --> 00:12:15,329
has been all you'd
hoped it would be.

185
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:18,065
Have we met?

186
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:20,801
You wouldn't
remember me if we had?

187
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:22,469
I meet a lot of men.

188
00:12:22,504 --> 00:12:24,972
And I think you
remember all of them.

189
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:28,609
I think your true talents
are wasted on them.

190
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:31,412
You're very kind,
My Lord.

191
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,880
Allow me to return
the favor.

192
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:42,756
You're afraid.

193
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,592
Why?
Nothing dangerous down there.

194
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:48,028
I know who you are.

195
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:51,231
And, unlike your
current employer,

196
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:53,967
I protect those
who work for me.

197
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:57,071
I don't abuse them
to satisfy royal whims

198
00:12:57,105 --> 00:12:59,673
or force them
to abuse each other.

199
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,442
How do you know
about that?

200
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:04,946
I thought you said
you knew who I was.

201
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:09,117
What can I do for you,
Lord Varys?

202
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:23,564
Littlefinger looks at you

203
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:26,033
and sees a collection
of profitable holes.

204
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:29,436
I see a potential
partner.

205
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:34,875
- I'm afraid of him.
- Oh, you should be.

206
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:37,578
He's a dangerous man.

207
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:40,881
But everyone has
their weaknesses.

208
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:45,086
Your current employer
hides his very well,

209
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,555
but not as well
as he thinks.

210
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:54,297
You're a virgin,
I take it?

211
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:56,398
Walk.

212
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,102
Childhood must have
been awful for you.

213
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:03,339
Were you a foot taller
than all the boys?

214
00:14:03,373 --> 00:14:06,342
They laughed at you,
called you names?

215
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,645
Some boys
like a challenge.

216
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:12,116
One or two must have
tried to get inside big Brienne.

217
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,186
- One or two tried.
- Ah.

218
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,421
But you fought them off.

219
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,491
But maybe you wished one
of them could overpower you,

220
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,960
fling you down,
tear off your clothes.

221
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,396
But none of them
were strong enough.

222
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,699
- I'm strong enough.
- Not interested.

223
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,268
Of course you are.

224
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,004
You'd love to know what it
feels like to be a woman.

225
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,510
<i>Ah. "They lay</i>
<i>with lions."</i>

226
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,211
Tavern girls, I'd say.

227
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,281
Probably served
my father's soldiers.

228
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,450
Maybe one of them
gave up a kiss and a feel.

229
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:48,985
That's how
they earned this.

230
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,889
The glorious work of the
northern freedom fighters.

231
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:55,158
Must make you proud
to serve the Starks.

232
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:59,163
I don't serve the Starks.
I serve Lady Catelyn.

233
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:02,099
Tell yourself that tonight
when they swing in your dreams.

234
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,103
( Groans )

235
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,874
- What are you doing?
- Burying them.

236
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,345
We shouldn't stay here.
We should get back on the river.

237
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,514
I think these women
would understand if--

238
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,015
I don't care
what you think.

239
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,416
Man:
<i>I didn't leave it here.</i>

240
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,552
Untie me now.

241
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,351
Man: <i>I gave it to you to cut</i>
<i>the rope, and now I don't</i>

242
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:22,754
<i>have me dagger no more.</i>

243
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,257
So unless it got stuck in your ass
on its way to your cunt,

244
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,259
it stands to reason
that it's gone-- whoa!

245
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:31,395
What's your business here?

246
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:33,396
Traveling a prisoner.

247
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,899
( Laughing )

248
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:39,203
You're a woman.
A woman!

249
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,306
<i>Well, fuck me!</i>

250
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,009
If you've quite
finished up--

251
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,011
( laughing )

252
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,913
All right,
we'll be going.

253
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,583
Whoa, whoa.

254
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,318
Who do you fight for?

255
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,820
The Starks.

256
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,024
What did he do?

257
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,160
Apparently eating is now a crime.
Who knew?

258
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,595
No, stealing is a crime.

259
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,064
But it's not a crime to starve.
That's justice for you.

260
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,266
- <i>Where are you taking him?</i>
- To Riverrun.

261
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,067
Why Riverrun?

262
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:12,836
Steal from the Tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.

263
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,338
- Why not kill him?
- For stealing a pig?

264
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,374
I don't give the orders.

265
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:18,942
He must be important
to someone.

266
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:22,145
Sending him with you?
How important could he be?

267
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:25,916
All right,
have it your way,

268
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,951
m'lady.

269
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:34,158
- Do I know you?
- Have you been to Ashemark?

270
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,327
- <i>No.</i>
- Then you don't know me.

271
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,497
Do you ever go to the river
market at Salt Rock?

272
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,067
- Is it near Ashemark?
- <i>No.</i>

273
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,502
I've never been there.

274
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,305
What do you think
of these beauties?

275
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,843
I hope you gave them
quick deaths.

276
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:52,813
Two of them we did, yeah.

277
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:57,217
Wait.

278
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:01,488
I do know you.

279
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:03,490
That's Jaime Lannister.

280
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:04,968
I wish someone had told me.

281
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:06,560
I wouldn't have had
to steal that pig.

282
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,896
If this is the Kingslayer,
I think I'd know about it.

283
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:10,732
How do you know what
the Kingslayer looks like?

284
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,968
I was at Whispering Wood.
I saw him.

285
00:17:13,002 --> 00:17:15,871
<i>They dragged him out of the woods</i>
<i>and threw him down before the King.</i>

286
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:18,440
He's not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.

287
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:20,542
If he was, I'd only
be traveling his head.

288
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:22,711
I have a question
for you both.

289
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:25,113
And I want you to answer it
at the same time.

290
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:27,749
<i>I count to three,</i>
<i>you both answer.</i>

291
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:30,185
What's his name?

292
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,554
One.

293
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:35,390
<i>Two. Three.</i>

294
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:52,273
Two quick deaths.

295
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,977
<i>( Man grunts )</i>

296
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:02,082
<i>( Slowly slicing )</i>

297
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,267
Those were Stark men.

298
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,336
I don't serve the Starks.

299
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,271
I serve Lady Catelyn.

300
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:29,807
I told her I'd take you
to King's Landing,

301
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:31,775
and that's what
I'm going to do.

302
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,746
Stay.

303
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,522
( Grunts )

304
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,192
- <i>( Bodies thud )</i>
- ( Groans )

305
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:56,403
Walder Frey is a dangerous
man to cross.

306
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:58,038
I know that.

307
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:00,240
And you mean
to do it anyway?

308
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:06,147
I love her.

309
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:08,549
I know that seems
important to you.

310
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,517
It is important to me.

311
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,755
Your father didn't love
me when we married.

312
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,025
He hardly knew me
or I him.

313
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:24,164
Love didn't just
happen to us.

314
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,835
We built it slowly
over the years,

315
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:28,904
stone by stone,

316
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:31,307
for you, for your
brothers and sisters,

317
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:33,909
for all of us.

318
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:37,979
It's not as exciting as
secret passion in the woods,

319
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:40,916
but it is stronger.

320
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,819
It lasts longer.

321
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:46,188
And that is what
would be in store for me

322
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:48,057
with one of
Walder Frey's daughters,

323
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:50,827
- what you and father had?
- Why not?

324
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:52,629
Because she's not beautiful?

325
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:54,665
Because she's not exotic
and exciting?

326
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:57,802
Now you're arguing just to argue
because you arranged it.

327
00:19:57,836 --> 00:20:00,672
And you agreed to it.

328
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:02,574
You gave him your word.

329
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:07,480
Treat your oaths recklessly and
your people will do the same.

330
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:09,315
If your father lived
his life for one thing--

331
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,551
My father is dead.

332
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,492
And the only parent
I have left has no right

333
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:15,228
to call anyone reckless.

334
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:32,836
<i>( Thunder rumbling )</i>

335
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,475
You said you saw
my victory in the flames.

336
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,543
Melisandre:
<i>I did.</i>

337
00:20:40,578 --> 00:20:43,213
- I still see it.
- The flames lied.

338
00:20:44,282 --> 00:20:47,317
And I'm no better
than a savage

339
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:49,453
trusting in a Fire God.

340
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:54,524
I fought for your God
in Blackwater Bay.

341
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,860
I led my men to the gates
of the Seventh Hell

342
00:20:57,894 --> 00:21:01,063
as their brothers burned
alive, and for what?

343
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:04,999
Attacked from behind by
Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.

344
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:07,235
If you see so much in your flames,
why didn't you warn me?

345
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:09,170
The Lord of Light
only allows me glimpses.

346
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:11,505
You claimed to speak
for a God.

347
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,840
Will you quit the war just
because you've lost a battle?

348
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:15,776
You talk about war
as if you understand it.

349
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,011
<i>I've been fighting</i>
<i>far longer than you.</i>

350
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:21,149
Have you?
Show me how you fight.

351
00:21:21,183 --> 00:21:23,685
( Gasping )

352
00:21:25,088 --> 00:21:27,790
Show me.

353
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:35,098
Where's your God now?

354
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,701
Will he save you?

355
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:41,537
Where is your God?

356
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:46,042
Inside you.

357
00:21:47,544 --> 00:21:49,978
( Groans )

358
00:21:50,012 --> 00:21:52,380
( Breathing heavily )

359
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:57,452
I murdered my brother.

360
00:22:00,423 --> 00:22:03,526
<i>( Thunder rumbles )</i>

361
00:22:05,763 --> 00:22:08,298
We murdered him.

362
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,067
Share the weight
with me.

363
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:12,503
He wasn't your brother.

364
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:19,443
This war
has just begun.

365
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:21,778
It will last for years.

366
00:22:21,813 --> 00:22:25,182
Thousands will die
at your command.

367
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:29,954
You will betray
the men serving you.

368
00:22:29,988 --> 00:22:32,823
You will betray
your family.

369
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:36,426
You will betray everything
you once held dear.

370
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:40,796
And it will all
be worth it

371
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:43,900
because you are
the Son of Fire.

372
00:22:43,935 --> 00:22:47,137
You are the Warrior
of Light.

373
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:52,875
You will sweep aside
this pretender and that one.

374
00:22:54,077 --> 00:22:56,512
You will be King.

375
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:03,052
You promise
these things, but...

376
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:05,387
you don't know.

377
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,491
None of us know.

378
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:10,660
Let me show you.

379
00:23:19,837 --> 00:23:21,737
Look into the fire,
my King.

380
00:23:21,772 --> 00:23:24,106
Look.

381
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:26,974
I see fire.

382
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,143
Keep looking.

383
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:31,579
<i>( Flame roaring )</i>

Do you see, my King?

386
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:02,276
Yes.

I will kill that man.

I don't care how many arrows
they feather me with,

390

how many spears
they run through me,

I will kill that horn-blowing

392

They want you to know
you're surrounded.

393
00:24:26,803 --> 00:24:28,804
I know I'm surrounded.

394
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:31,607
I know that because I stood
on the battlements

395
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:33,543
and saw I was surrounded.

396

<i>They don't want</i>
<i>you to sleep.</i>

397

They want to sap
your spirit before--

398
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:40,750
Thank you, wise bald man.

399
00:24:40,784 --> 00:24:44,119
Thank you for explaining
siege tactics to me.

400

<i>( Horn continues )</i>

401
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:49,791
No word from my father?

402

No.

403
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,730
Send more ravens.

404
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,002
You killed
all the ravens.

405
00:25:02,606 --> 00:25:05,275
The first time
I saw Winterfell...

406
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:08,345
<i>( Horn blowing )</i>

407
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:14,252
The first time
I saw Winterfell,

408
00:25:14,286 --> 00:25:16,197
it looked like something
that had been here for

409
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:18,222
thousands of years

410
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:20,858
and would be here
for thousands of years

411
00:25:20,892 --> 00:25:23,126
after I was dead.

412
00:25:24,562 --> 00:25:27,663
I saw it
and I thought,

413
00:25:27,697 --> 00:25:30,332
"of course Ned Stark
crushed our rebellion

414
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:33,102
and killed my brothers.

415
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:35,671
We never stood a chance against
a man who lives here."

416
00:25:35,705 --> 00:25:38,408
Lord Stark went out of his way
to make it your home.

417
00:25:38,442 --> 00:25:40,944
Yes, my captors were
so very kind to me.

418
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:43,346
You love
reminding me of that.

419
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:47,117
Everyone in this
frozen pile of shit

420
00:25:47,152 --> 00:25:49,687
has always loved
reminding me of that.

421
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:54,560
You know what it's like
to be told how lucky you are

422
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,595
to be someone's prisoner?

423
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,400
To be told how much
you owe them?

424
00:26:03,836 --> 00:26:07,038
And then to go back home
to your real father...

425
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,076
<i>( Horn blowing )</i>

426

I serve Winterfell.

433
00:26:24,892 --> 00:26:27,894
Now Winterfell is yours.

434
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:30,430
I'm bound by oath
to serve you.

435
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,233
And what's your counsel,
trusted friend?

436
00:26:33,268 --> 00:26:35,536
Run.

437
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,098
500 Northmen wait
outside the walls.

438
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:39,973
You have 20 men.

439
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:41,908
You can't win.

440
00:26:41,943 --> 00:26:44,110
Wait for nightfall
and run.

441
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,612
There's nowhere to run.

442
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,614
I'd never make it back
to the Iron Islands.

443
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,350
And even if I did,
even if by some miracle

444
00:26:51,384 --> 00:26:54,219
I slipped through the lines
and made it home,

445
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:56,555
I'd be a coward.

446
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,325
The Greyjoy who ran.

447
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:03,195
The shame of the family.

448
00:27:04,864 --> 00:27:06,632
Don't go home.

449

<i>Join the Night's Watch.</i>

450
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:14,606
Once a man
has taken the Black...

451
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:19,678
he's beyond reach
of the law.

452
00:27:19,712 --> 00:27:22,814
All his past crimes
are forgiven.

453
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,885
I won't make it
to the Wall.

454
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,222
I won't make it 10 feet
past the Winterfell gates.

455
00:27:30,256 --> 00:27:32,424
There are ways.

456
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:35,293
Hidden passageways built
so the Lords of Winterfell

457
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,696
could escape.

458
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,398
The road will be dangerous.

459
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:44,603
But with a little luck...

460
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:52,177
the Night's Watch is an ancient,
honorable order.

461
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,881
You'll have
opportunities there.

462
00:27:57,351 --> 00:28:01,687
The opportunity for Jon Snow
to cut my throat in my sleep.

463
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:05,758
The opportunity to make
amends for what you've done.

464
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,263
I've done a lot,
haven't I?

465
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:14,166
Things I never
imagined myself doing.

466
00:28:16,402 --> 00:28:20,472
I've known you many years,
Theon Greyjoy.

467
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:26,212
You're not the man

Not yet.

469
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,587
You may be right.

470
00:28:37,957 --> 00:28:41,326
But I've gone too far
to pretend to be anything else.

That's the mating call

They say every Ironborn man is
worth a dozen from the mainland.

478
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:10,354
Men:
Aye!

479
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:14,392
- You think they're right?
- Men: Aye.

480
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:18,229
We die today, brothers.

481
00:29:18,263 --> 00:29:21,398
We die bleeding
from 100 wounds

482
00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:26,236
with arrows in our necks
and spears in our guts,

483
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:30,107
but our war cries will echo
through eternity.

484
00:29:30,141 --> 00:29:33,110
They will sing about
the battle of Winterfell

485
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:36,046
until the Iron Islands have
slipped beneath the waves.

486
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,050
Every man, woman, and child
will know who we were

487
00:29:40,084 --> 00:29:42,819
and how long we stood.

488
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:44,688
Aggar and Gelmarr;

489
00:29:44,722 --> 00:29:46,223
Wex and Urzen;

490
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:48,358
Stygg and Black Lorren--

491
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:51,661
Ironborn warriors
will cry out our names

492
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:54,998
as they leap onto the shores
of Seagard and Faircastle.

493
00:29:55,032 --> 00:29:56,466
Men: Aye!

494
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,135
- Mothers will name their sons for us.
- Aye!

495
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:01,837
Girls will think of us
with their lovers inside them.

496
00:30:01,872 --> 00:30:03,405
- Aye!
- <i>( Horn blowing )</i>

497
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,508
And whoever kills
that fucking horn-blower

498
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:08,611
will stand in bronze
above the shores of Pyke!

499
00:30:08,645 --> 00:30:10,145
Men: Aye!

500
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,014
- What is dead may never die!
- What is dead may never die!

501
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:15,483
Ah!

502
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:19,788
Thought he'd never shut up.

503
00:30:19,822 --> 00:30:22,223
It was a good speech.

504
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:23,958
Didn't want to interrupt.

505
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:29,230
What is this?

506
00:30:29,264 --> 00:30:31,065
What are you doing?

507
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:33,900
( Groans )

508
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:39,073
Let's go home.

509
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,412
Man:
<i>Come on.</i>

510
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:52,188
<i>( Raven cawing )</i>

511
00:30:52,222 --> 00:30:53,690
Tyrion:
<i>Why should I believe you?</i>

512
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:55,291
Why would I lie
about it?

513
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:58,060
To create strife between
my sister and me.

514
00:30:58,095 --> 00:31:00,864
Where before there was
nothing but love.

515
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:05,334
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill
you on your sister's orders.

516
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:07,870
If it weren't for your
Squire's bravery,

517
00:31:07,904 --> 00:31:10,539
you'd be a dead man.

518
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:14,309
- <i>Pod.</i>
- Yes, My Lord?

519
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:16,980
Would it be
excessive of me

520
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:19,683
to ask you to save
my life twice in a week?

521
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:21,952
No, My Lord.

522
00:31:21,986 --> 00:31:24,455
<i>You're a good lad.</i>

523
00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:27,291
Get Bronn, tell him I want
four of his most loyal

524
00:31:27,326 --> 00:31:29,261
Gold Cloaks outside
my door at all times.

525
00:31:29,295 --> 00:31:31,630
I'm afraid your friend
has been relieved

526
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:33,899
of his command
of the City Watch.

527
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,603
The Gold Cloaks are now firmly
in the hands of your father

528
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:39,371
or your sister.

529
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:42,208
It varies
from cloak to cloak.

530
00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:45,211
- Then my hill tribesmen.
- Have gone home.

531
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:48,481
Your father paid them
quite handsomely.

532
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:54,454
I'm afraid we won't
be seeing each other

533
00:31:54,488 --> 00:31:56,556
for some time, My Lord.

534
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,327
Don't want to swim too close
to a drowning man?

535
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:03,596
And I thought
we were friends.

536
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,566
We are.

537
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,534
Podrick, would you mind?

538
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:26,418
There are many who know
that without you

539
00:32:26,452 --> 00:32:30,089
this city faced
certain defeat.

540
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:32,291
<i>The King won't give</i>
<i>you any honors,</i>

541
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,827
<i>the histories</i>
<i>won't mention you,</i>

542
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:38,063
but we will not forget.

543
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:42,134
Come along now, Podrick.

544
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,676
- My love.
- <i>( Door closes )</i>

545
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,310
It was good of you
to come.

546
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:51,946
Good of me?

547
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,015
Of course I come.

548
00:32:58,053 --> 00:33:00,721
- I want to see you.
- Believe me, you don't.

549
00:33:01,823 --> 00:33:03,691
Have you looked?

550
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:06,626
I will be the first.

551
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:18,004
( Groans )

552
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:32,354
Well?

553
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:35,358
You are a mess.

554
00:33:37,094 --> 00:33:39,762
I'm a monster
as well as a dwarf.

555
00:33:39,796 --> 00:33:41,297
You should charge
me double.

556
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:43,065
You think I'm here
for money?

557
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:45,034
That was the arrangement
we made.

558
00:33:45,068 --> 00:33:48,103
I pay you
and you lie to me.

559
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:50,672
Aw, I'm a poor
little rich man

560
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:52,647
and nobody loves me,
so I make jokes all the time

561
00:33:52,672 --> 00:33:54,226
and pay them to laugh.

562
00:33:54,777 --> 00:33:56,544
Fuck your money.

563
00:33:57,513 --> 00:33:58,613
Let's leave.

564
00:33:58,648 --> 00:34:00,615
- Leave?
- Leave King's Landing.

565
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,185
They tried to kill you.
They will try again.

566
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:05,454
Going into wars,
fighting soldiers--

567
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:07,090
you're terrible at this.

568
00:34:08,692 --> 00:34:11,261
Let's take a boat to Pentos
and never come back.

569
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:12,896
You don't belong here.

570
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:14,699
What would we do
in Pentos?

571
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:17,468
Eat, drink,

572
00:34:17,503 --> 00:34:19,770
fuck, live.

573
00:34:23,843 --> 00:34:26,078
I want to go with you.

574
00:34:26,112 --> 00:34:27,679
So do it.

575
00:34:27,714 --> 00:34:29,948
Your father, your sister,
all these bad people,

576
00:34:29,983 --> 00:34:31,750
they can't stop you.

577
00:34:31,785 --> 00:34:34,219
Forget about them.
Come with me.

578
00:34:36,723 --> 00:34:38,423
I can't.

579
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:41,292
I do belong here.

580
00:34:42,228 --> 00:34:44,463
These bad people

581
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:46,131
are what I'm good at.

582
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:48,567
Outtalking them,
outthinking them.

583
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:50,903
It's what I am.

584
00:34:52,305 --> 00:34:55,141
And I like it.

585
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:58,577
I like it more than
anything I've ever done.

586
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,518
Are you going to leave?

587
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,626
You have a shit memory.

588
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:18,697
I am yours
and you are mine.

589
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:20,766
( Crying )

590
00:35:30,943 --> 00:35:33,545
Septon: In the sight
of the Seven,

591
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:37,616
I hereby seal
these two souls,

592
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:42,421
binding them as one
for eternity.

593
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:50,595
Look upon one another
and say the words.

594
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,233
Both:
Father, smith,

595
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:58,234
warrior, mother,

596
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:01,805
maiden, crone,
stranger...

597
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,541
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

598
00:36:04,575 --> 00:36:08,078
from this day
until the end of my days.

599
00:36:32,574 --> 00:36:37,211
( Speaking Dothraki )

600
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:18,886
Is this a riddle?

601
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:01,194
Khaleesi!

602
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:04,030
Khaleesi!

603
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:09,002
Jorah:
<i>Khaleesi!</i>

604
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:14,907
Are you trying to frighten me
with magic tricks?

605
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:17,643
You want me?
Here I am.

606
00:38:17,678 --> 00:38:19,746
Are you afraid
of a little girl?

607
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,282
<i>( Dragons screeching )</i>

608
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,822
<i>( Screeching continues )</i>

609
00:38:44,204 --> 00:38:46,505
Hot pie:
<i>How did he find us?</i>

610
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:12,565
What are you doing here?

611
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,267
Waiting for you.

612
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:16,970
How did you know
we'd come this way?

613
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:18,872
After all the things
you have seen,

614
00:39:18,906 --> 00:39:20,907
this is your question?

615
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,577
How did you
kill those guards?

616
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,979
Was it hard?

617
00:39:26,013 --> 00:39:28,748
No harder than taking a new name
if you know the way.

618
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:32,419
Show me how. I want
to be able to do it, too.

619
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,621
If you would learn,
you must come with me.

620
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,222
Where?

621
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:39,459
Far and away across
the Narrow Sea to Braavos.

622
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:41,561
My dancing master
was from Braavos.

623
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:43,029
( Chuckles )

624
00:39:43,063 --> 00:39:44,831
To be a dancing master
is a special thing,

625
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:47,467
but to be a faceless man--

626
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:49,436
that is something
else entirely.

627
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,673
A girl has many names
on her lips--

628
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:55,976
Joffrey, Cersei,
Tywin Lannister,

629
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,844
Ilyn Payne, the Hound.

630
00:39:57,879 --> 00:40:01,315
Names to offer up
to the Red God.

631
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:05,151
She could offer them all
one by one.

632
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:09,422
I want to.

633
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:14,359
But I can't.

634
00:40:14,394 --> 00:40:17,496
I need to find
my brother and mother.

635
00:40:18,398 --> 00:40:20,132
And my sister.

636
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:23,802
I need to find
her, too.

637
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:27,272

A coin of great value.

Could it buy a horse?

It is not meant

If the day comes when
you must find me again,

just give that coin

that's so interesting is--

802
01:00:51,005 --> 01:00:53,273
- Just bloody kill me.
- No, truly.

803
01:00:53,308 --> 01:00:56,510
The thing about her that
I find so interesting is that

804
01:00:56,544 --> 01:00:59,079
after all that
Craster's done to her,

805
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,615
she's still got hope that
life might get better.

806
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:04,884
The thing about Gilly
that you find so interesting

807
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:07,687
is that she said
six words to you.

808
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:10,856
And the thing about you
that I find so interesting

809
01:01:10,891 --> 01:01:12,858
is absolutely nothing.

You're not fighting them alone.
Come on.

Three blasts?

818
01:01:35,014 --> 01:01:37,115
Run!

819
01:01:42,822 --> 01:01:45,524
Wait! Wait for me!
