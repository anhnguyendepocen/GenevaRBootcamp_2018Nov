Varys: <i>You've seen</i>
<i>better days, My Lord.</i>

7
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:12,803
Another visit?

8
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:16,572
It seems
you're my last friend.

9
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:19,375
No no,
many still love you.

10
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,677
Sansa came to court
this morning

11
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:24,846
to plead for your life.

12
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:28,649
On her knees,
begging for me, hmmm.

13
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,651
Did you laugh
with the others?

14
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,486
You do me wrong, My Lord.

15
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,721
Your blood is
the last thing I want.

16
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,556
I don't know
what you want.

17
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,524
I've given up
trying to guess.

18
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,996
When I was still a boy--

19
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,233
before they cut my balls off
with a hot knife--

20
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:51,570
I traveled with a group
of actors through the free cities.

21
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,141
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

22
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,077
The same is true
at court.

23
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,446
I am the master
of whisperers.

24
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,349
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

25
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:07,785
I'm a good actor,
My Lord.

26
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:11,321
Huh.
Can you free me from this pit?

27
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:13,088
I could.

28
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:14,756
But will I?

29
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,424
- No.
- ( Laughs )

30
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,292
As I said,
I'm no hero.

31
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,360
What do you want?
Tell me.

32
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:24,361
No riddles, no stories--
tell me, what do you want?

33
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:28,063
Peace.

34
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:30,898
Did you know that
your son is marching south

35
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:34,000
with an army of Northmen?
Loyal lad--

36
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:36,670
fighting for
his father's freedom.

37
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:38,938
Robb?

38
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:40,972
He's just a boy.

39
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:43,441
Boys have been
conquerors before.

40
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,776
But the man giving Cersei
sleepless nights

41
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:49,379
is the King's--
the late King's brother.

42
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:52,882
Lord Stannis has the best
claim to the Throne,

43
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:56,118
he is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

44
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,286
Stannis Baratheon
is Robert's true heir.

45
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,588
The Throne
is his by rights.

46
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:05,158
Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded
so sweetly for your life,

47
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:07,427
it would be a shame
to throw it away.

48
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:10,196
Cersei is no fool.

49
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:14,233
She knows a tame wolf is more
use to her than a dead one.

50
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,035
You want me to serve the
woman who murdered my King,

51
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:19,804
who butchered my men,
who crippled my son?

52
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,907
I want you
to serve the realm!

53
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:24,677
Tell the Queen you will confess
your vile treason,

54
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,980
tell your son
to lay down his sword

55
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:30,284
and proclaim Joffrey
as the true heir.

56
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:35,189
Cersei knows you
as a man of honor.

57
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:37,291
If you give her
the peace she needs

58
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:40,194
and promise to carry
her secret to your grave,

59
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:44,030
I believe she will allow you to take
the Black and live out your days

60
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:46,498
on the Wall with your brother
and your bastard son.

61
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:47,799
( Chuckles )

62
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:50,601
You think my life is
some precious thing to me?

63
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:55,439
That I would trade my honor
for a few more years of...

64
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:57,241
Of what?

65
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,114
You grew up with actors.

66
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:09,418
You learned their craft
and you learned it well.

67
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:12,053
But I grew up
with soldiers.

68
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:17,224
I learned how to die
a long time ago.

69
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:22,028
Pity.

70
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:24,330
<i>Such a pity.</i>

71
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:33,438
What of your
daughter's life, My Lord?

72
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:36,574
<i>Is that a precious</i>
<i>thing to you?</i>

73
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:42,545
<i>( Water dripping )</i>

74
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:52,653
( Cawing )

75
00:05:58,393 --> 00:06:00,126
( Arrow thunks )

76
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,340
It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

77
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,476
Or so Walder Frey
would have you think.

78
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,811
Keep shooting them down.
We can't risk Lord Walder

79
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:27,446
sending word of your movements
to the Lannisters.

80
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:30,482
He's grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

81
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:34,451
Greatjon: Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

82
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:36,587
Look.

83
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:39,656
Robb: <i>Father rots</i>
<i>in a dungeon.</i>

84
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,724
How long before
they take his head?

85
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:45,060
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

86
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:47,495
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

87
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,498
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

88
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:53,901
Greatjon: Not in time. Tywin Lannister
marches north as we speak.

89
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:56,669
Catelyn: The Freys have held
the crossing for 600 years,

90
00:06:56,703 --> 00:07:00,105
and for 600 years they have never
failed to exact their toll.

91
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,973
Have my horse
saddled and ready.

92
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,710
Enter the Twins alone
and he'll sell you to the Lannis.

93
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:08,578
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

94
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:14,017
My father would do whatever
it took to secure our crossing.

95
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:16,253
Whatever it took.

96
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:18,188
If I'm going
to lead this army,

97
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:20,725
I can't have other men
doing my bargaining for me.

98
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,295
I agree.

99
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,864
- I'll go.
- Theon: <i>You can't!</i>

100
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:28,499
I have known Lord Walder
since I was a girl.

101
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,167
He would never
harm me.

102
00:07:30,202 --> 00:07:32,836
Greatjon: <i>Unless there was</i>
<i>a profit in it.</i>

103
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:40,342
What do you want?

104
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,044
It is a great pleasure to see you
again after so many years, My Lord.

105
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,879
Oh spare me.

106
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:48,882
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

107
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,184
What am I supposed
to do with you?

108
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:55,554
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here--

109
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:59,023
Who asked you?
You're not Lord Frey yet,

110
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:01,525
not until I die.
Do I look dead to you?

111
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,470
Father, please--

112
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:05,108
I need lessons in courtesy
from you, bastard?

113
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,997
Your mother would still
be a milkmaid

114
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:10,933
if I hadn't squirted you
into her belly.

115
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:17,672
All right,
you come forward.

116
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:29,115
( Smacking kiss )

117
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,517
There. Now that I've observed
the courtesies,

118
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:35,220
<i>perhaps my sons will do me the honor</i>
<i>of shutting their mouths.</i>

119
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:42,526
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

120
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,462
We're talking
right now.

121
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:50,266
Fine.

122
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,934
Out! All of you!

123
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:04,779
- ( Grunts )
- You too.

124
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:14,154
You see that?

125
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:15,789
15 she is.

126
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:18,258
A little flower.

127
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:22,795
And her honey's all mine.
( Lecherous chuckle )

128
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,333
I'm sure she will
give you many sons.

129
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:31,103
Huh. Your father didn't
come to the wedding.

130
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,472
He is quite ill, My Lord.

131
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,408
Didn't come to
the last one either.

132
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,911
Or the one before that.

133
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,514
Your family has always
pissed on me.

134
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,349
- My Lord, I--
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

135
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,752
The fine Lord Tully

136
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:50,053
would never marry any
of his children to mine.

137
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:52,021
I'm sure there
were reasons why--

138
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,690
I didn't need reasons.
I needed to get rid

139
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:58,260
of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

140
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:04,431
Why are you here?

141
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:07,099
To ask you

142
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:09,434
to open your gates,
My Lord,

143
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:13,949
so my son and his bannermen may cross
the Trident and be on their way.

144
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,183
Why should I let him?

145
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,157
If you could climb
your own battlements,

146
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:21,011
you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.

147
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:24,447
They'll be 20,000 corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

148
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,949
Don't try and frighten me,
Lady Stark.

149
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:29,518
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

150
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:32,454
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

151
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:34,923
You swore an oath
to my father.

152
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:37,225
Oh yes, I said some words...

153
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:41,094
And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.

154
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:44,930
Joffrey's King now,
which makes your boy

155
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:48,500
and his corpses-to-be nothing
but rebels, it seems to me.

156
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:52,369
If I had the sense
the Gods gave a fish,

157
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,438
I'd hand you both
over to the Lannisters.

158
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:57,007
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully,

159
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,309
Lannister, Baratheon,

160
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:02,011
give me one good reason

161
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:05,481
why I should waste
a single thought on any of you?

162
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:08,851
<i>- And... engage.</i>
<i>- ( Wind gusting )</i>

163
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,026
<i>( Door closes )</i>

164
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:12,384
When does Aemon think you'll
be able to use that hand?

165
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:15,490
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

166
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:19,494
You'll be ready
for this then.

167
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,764
I thought a wolf was
more appropriate for you

168
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:24,866
than a bear...

169
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:28,870
So I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

170
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:32,739
Works as well for a wolf
as a bear, I think.

171
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:46,250
This is Valyrian steel.

172
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:49,052
It was my father's sword,

173
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:50,954
his father before him.

174
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:54,590
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

175
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,692
It was meant
for my son Jorah.

176
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:59,461
He brought dishonor
to our House,

177
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:01,997
but he had the grace
to leave the sword

178
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:04,800
before he fled
from Westeros.

179
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:07,169
My Lord, you honor me,
but I can't--

180
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:09,770
Oh, you can
and you will.

181
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:14,140
I wouldn't be standing here if it
wasn't for you and your beast.

182
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:18,444
A bloody dead man
tried to kill me...

183
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,281
So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.

184
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:26,050
- Is that understood?
- Yes, My Lord.

185
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:29,152
Right.
Now don't think this means

186
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:31,488
I approve
of this nonsense

187
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:33,590
with you
and Alliser Thorne.

188
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:36,158
That's a man's sword,

189
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:38,861
it'll take
a man to wield it.

190
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:40,897
I'll apologize
to Ser Alliser tonight.

191
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:42,365
No you won't!

192
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,467
I sent him to King's Landing
yesterday.

193
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,703
The hand that your wolf

194
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:48,304
tore off
that thing's wrist--

195
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,041
I've ordered Thorne to lay it
at the feet of this...

196
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,909
Boy King.

197
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:56,778
That should get young
Joffrey's attention.

198
00:12:56,812 --> 00:13:00,313
And it puts
a thousand leagues

199
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,115
between you and Thorne.

200
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,651
Now go and put your sword
somewhere safe

201
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,286
and bring me
my supper.

202
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,787
Yes, My Lord.

203
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:23,899
- Well done.
- Well done.

204
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:27,670
You earned that, Snow.

205
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,673
Well done.

206
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:39,409
Go on,
let's have a look.

207
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,845
- At what?
- Grenn: The sword! Show us the sword.

208
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:45,082
( Chanting ) Sword! Sword!
Sword! Sword!

209
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:51,155
( Laughter, cheers )

210
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:55,159
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

211
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:58,195
Get off of it.
Piss off.

212
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,664
Come on, I want to have
a look at it in the light.

213
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:06,237
Pyp:
Give it here!

214
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:08,139
What is it?

215
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,241
- I--
- Look at its eyes.

216
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:11,809
- Give it.
- I can't.

217
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:14,612
You can't what?

218
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:19,182
I-- I'm really not
supposed to say.

219
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:22,685
And yet you really
want to say.

220
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,454
You want to say
that...?

221
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:30,726
There was a raven.

222
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,128
I read the message
to Maester Aemon.

223
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,931
It's your brother Robb.

224
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:39,099
What?

225
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:40,934
What about him?

226
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:43,903
He's heading south.

227
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:45,805
To war.

228
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:51,143
All his bannermen have rallied
to his side. They'll keep him safe.

229
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:55,313
I should be there.

230
00:14:57,115 --> 00:14:59,650
I should be with him.

231
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:02,286
<i>( Hoofbeats approaching )</i>

232
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,996
...If we do that, they'll never
get back across.

233
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,566
Robb: Well?

234
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,101
What did he say?

235
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:25,003
Lord Walder has granted
your crossing.

236
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:29,974
- His men are yours as well--
- Greatjon: Huh.

237
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:32,209
--Less the 400 he will keep here
to hold the crossing

238
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:33,945
against any who would
pursue you.

239
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:35,380
And what does
he want in return?

240
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:39,016
You will be taking on his son
Olyvar as your personal squire.

241
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,753
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine fine.

242
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:46,189
And?

243
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:49,225
And Arya

244
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,427
will marry his son Waldron

245
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:54,530
- <i>when they both come of age.</i>
- She won't be happy about that.

246
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:56,298
Hmmm.

247
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:00,669
And?

248
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,406
And

249
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:07,476
when the fighting
is done...

250
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:11,380
You will marry
one of his daughters.

251
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,350
<i>Whichever you prefer.</i>

252
00:16:14,384 --> 00:16:17,887
He has a number he thinks
will be... suitable.

253
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:19,989
I see.

254
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:24,126
- Did you get a look at his daughters?
- ( Snickering )

255
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,927
<i>I did.</i>

256
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:28,195
And?

257
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:31,398
One was...

258
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:38,671
Do you consent?

259
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,640
Can I refuse?

260
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:42,841
Not if you want to cross.

261
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:48,313
Then I consent.

262
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,817
( Chuckles )

263
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:25,111
<i>( Cawing )</i>

264
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,454
Sam said you wanted
to see me?

265
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,356
I did indeed.

266
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,055
Perhaps you would be
kind enough to assist me.

267
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:46,793
Tell me,
did you ever wonder

268
00:17:46,827 --> 00:17:49,695
why the men
of The Night's Watch

269
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:52,597
take no wives
and father no children?

270
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:54,732
No.

271
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:57,201
So they will not love.

272
00:17:57,235 --> 00:18:00,770
<i>Love is the death</i>
<i>of duty.</i>

273
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:04,774
If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose

274
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:07,409
between honor
on the one hand

275
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:10,078
and those he loves
on the other,

276
00:18:10,113 --> 00:18:12,147
what would he do?

277
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:16,550
He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

278
00:18:16,585 --> 00:18:21,355
Then Lord Stark
is one man in 10,000.

279
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:24,524
Most of us are not
so strong.

280
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:26,392
What is honor

281
00:18:26,426 --> 00:18:29,028
compared
to a woman's love?

282
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:31,630
<i>And what is duty</i>

283
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:35,200
<i>against the feel of a newborn son</i>
<i>in your arms?</i>

284
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:38,903
Or a brother's smile?

285
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,640
Sam told you.

286
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:45,575
We're all human.

287
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:49,177
Oh, we all do our duty when
there's no cost to it.

288
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:52,013
Honor comes easy then.

289
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,983
Yet sooner or later

290
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:57,885
in every man's life

291
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,788
there comes a day
when it is not easy,

292
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:04,090
a day when
he must choose.

293
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:07,893
And this is my day?

294
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:10,028
Is that what
you're saying?

295
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:13,198
Oh, it hurts, boy.
Oh yes.

296
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:16,300
- I know.
- You do not know!

297
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:20,104
No one knows.

298
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,007
I may be a bastard,

299
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:26,510
but he is my father
and Robb is my brother.

( Chuckles )

301
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:34,652
The Gods were cruel when they
saw fit to test my vows.

302
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:37,156
They waited till I was old.

303
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:42,295
What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South--

304
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:45,230
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

305
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,899
I was helpless,

306
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:50,734
blind, frail.

307
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:55,438
But when I heard

308
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:58,073
they had killed
my brother's son,

309
00:19:58,107 --> 00:20:00,175
and his poor son...

310
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:01,642
And the children!

311
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:04,879
Even the little children.

312
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:07,981
Who are you?

313
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:13,853
My father was Maekar,

314
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,221
the first of his name.

315
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,458
My brother Aegon
reigned after him

316
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:23,460
when I had refused
the Throne.

317
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:27,064
And he was followed
by his son Aerys,

318
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:29,766
whom they called
the Mad King.

319
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,102
You're Aemon Targaryen.

320
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:36,071
I'm a Maester
of the Citadel,

321
00:20:36,106 --> 00:20:41,643
bound in service to Castle Black
and The Night's Watch.

322
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,915
I will not tell you
to stay or go.

323
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:51,418
You must make
that choice yourself,

324
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:55,454
and live with it
for the rest of your days.

325
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,891
As I have.

326
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,509
( Daenerys speaking Dothraki )

327
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:27,513
Drogo.

328
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:31,416
( Mutters )

329
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,417
<i>( Grunts )</i>

330
00:21:36,053 --> 00:21:38,790
<i>Sajo anni.</i>

331
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:34,309
Hyah hyah.

332
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,727
Kevan:
<i>Our scouts tell us</i>

333
00:22:55,762 --> 00:22:58,430
<i>the Stark host has moved</i>
<i>south from the Twins</i>

334
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:01,165
with Lord Frey's levies
in tow.

335
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:03,300
They're a day's
march north.

336
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:06,003
The boy may lack
experience and sense,

337
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:09,106
<i>but he does have</i>
<i>a certain mindless</i>

338
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,442
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

339
00:23:15,912 --> 00:23:18,179
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

340
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:20,715
I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

341
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:22,717
otherwise we've wasted
good steel on them.

342
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:26,153
The great hairy one insisted he
must have two battle axes--

343
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:28,722
heavy black steel,
double-sided.

344
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:30,690
Shagga likes axes.

345
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:33,325
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings

346
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,560
<i>will be in the vanguard.</i>

347
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:37,028
- The vanguard?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

348
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:38,929
Me and the tribesmen
on the front lines?

349
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:42,467
<i>They do seem</i>
<i>rather ferocious.</i>

350
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:47,840
Ferocious?
Last night

351
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:51,510
a Moon brother stabbed
a Stone Crow over a sausage.

352
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:55,415
<i>Three Stone Crows seized the Moon</i>
<i>brother and opened his throat.</i>

353
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,418
Bronn managed to keep Shagga from
chopping off the dead man's cock,

354
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:00,654
which was fortunate,
but even still

355
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:02,489
Ulf is demanding
blood money,

356
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:05,125
which Shagga and Gunthor
refuse to pay.

357
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,261
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

358
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:09,829
Surely there are ways
to have me killed

359
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:11,899
that would be less detrimental
to the war effort.

360
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:14,635
There'll be no more
discussion on the matter.

361
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:22,075
It appears I'm not
hungry after all.

362
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:23,977
Excuse me, My Lords.

363
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:39,657
Where did you find one
so pretty at this hour?

364
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:42,426
- I took her.
- Took her?

365
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,495
- From whom?
- From, uh...

366
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:47,396
Ser-- what's his name?

367
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:50,132
I don't know.
Ginger cunt three tents down.

368
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:53,369
<i>And he didn't have anything</i>
<i>to say about it?</i>

369
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:56,905
He said something.

370
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:01,975
Well, the odds of me
living long enough

371
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,611
for him to retaliate
just dropped drastically.

372
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:07,046
We'll be at
the vanguard tomorrow.

373
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,916
Oh well.

374
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:17,221
I... think I'll go
and find myself one.

375
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,191
Who are you?

376
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:24,526
( Foreign accent )
Who would you like me to be?

377
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:26,962
What did your mother
call you?

378
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:28,748
Shae.

379
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:30,509
What did your
mother call you?

380
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,102
My mother died
giving birth to me.

381
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:36,672
Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

382
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:40,208
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

383
00:25:40,276 --> 00:25:42,076
For--

384
00:25:43,478 --> 00:25:45,212
What do you want
from me?

385
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:47,981
What do I want from you?

386
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:51,351
( Exhales )
I want you to share my tent.

387
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:54,420
I want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

388
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:57,257
rub my legs when they're
sore after a day's ride.

389
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,559
I want you to take
no other man to bed

390
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:01,560
for as long
as we're together.

391
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:05,764
And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world--

392
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:08,067
which it may well be.

393
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,703
And what do I get?

394
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:12,973
One: Safety.

395
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:15,743
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

396
00:26:16,812 --> 00:26:19,145
Two: The pleasure
of my company,

397
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,147
which I have heard
is spectacular.

398
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,516
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

399
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,652
And three: More gold

400
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:31,154
<i>than you can spend if you</i>
<i>lived a thousand years.</i>

401
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:34,290
Do you accept my proposal?

402
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:55,840
Let's start with your last night
in this world.

403
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
Doth-- Dothrae...

404
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,026
Ki ha-- hammi...

405
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:24,762
Ish nokitta...

406
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:26,764
Qana'th...

407
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,134
Jorah:
<i>Khaleesi.</i>

408
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:31,568
Come.

409
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:35,972
He's very strong.

410
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:39,141
No one understands
how strong he is.

411
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:55,722
( Gasps )

412
00:27:57,424 --> 00:28:01,026
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

413
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,762
He can't.
I won't let him.

414
00:28:03,796 --> 00:28:07,031
Even a Queen doesn't
have that power.

415
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:12,936
We must go quickly. I've heard
there's a good port in Asshai--

416
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,173
- I won't leave him. 
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

417
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:19,241
Doth--

418
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:21,176
Even if--

419
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:24,279
( sobs )
--Even if he dies,

420
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:27,116
why would <i>I</i> run?

421
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,351
<i>I am Khaleesi</i>

422
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:32,988
and my-- my son will be
Khal after Drogo.

423
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:36,091
This isn't Westeros
where men honor blood.

424
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:39,127
Here they only honor strength.
There will be fighting

425
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:40,962
<i>after Drogo dies.</i>

426
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:43,632
Whoever wins that fight
will be the new Khal.

427
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,867
He won't want any rivals.

428
00:28:45,902 --> 00:28:48,503
Your boy will be plucked
from your breast

429
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:50,705
<i>and given to the dogs.</i>

430
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,442
I won't leave him.

431
00:29:03,953 --> 00:29:06,921
The wound
has festered.

432
00:30:01,905 --> 00:30:03,873
( Exhales )

433
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:09,812
I think you should wear
your armor tonight, Ser.

434
00:30:09,846 --> 00:30:12,447
I think you're right.

435
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:18,653
You've saved me
once more.

436
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:21,322
And now you <i>must</i>
save him.

437
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:23,725
He's beyond
the healer's skills.

438
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,460
All I can do is
ease his path.

439
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:28,628
Save him and I will free you.
I swear it.

440
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:31,932
You must know a way...

441
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:33,800
Some...

442
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,701
Some magic.

443
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:40,205
There is a spell.

444
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,473
Some would say death
is cleaner.

445
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:55,019
Do it.

446
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,120
Save him.

447
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,954
There is a price.

448
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:00,493
You'll have gold--
whatever you want.

449
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:02,991
It's not a matter of gold.
This is Bloodmagic.

450
00:31:03,026 --> 00:31:05,293
Only death pays for life.

451
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:10,196
My death?

452
00:31:10,231 --> 00:31:13,232
No.
Not your death, Khaleesi.

453
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,402
Bring me his horse.

454
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:30,218
( Neighing )

455
00:31:39,828 --> 00:31:41,462
Khaleesi,
do not do this thing.

456
00:31:41,496 --> 00:31:45,265
- <i>Let me kill this witch.</i>
- Kill her and you kill your Khal.

457
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:48,101
This is Bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

458
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:51,904
I am your Khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

459
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:54,941
( Incanting )

460
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:03,616
Go now!

461
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,852
- Take her and leave.
- Huh-uh.

462
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:08,054
Take her!

463
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:11,491
Irriya?

464
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,327
You must go also, lady.

465
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:16,662
<i>Once I begin to sing,</i>
<i>no one must enter the tent.</i>

466
00:32:16,697 --> 00:32:19,465
The dead will
dance here tonight.

467
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:34,547
No one will enter.

468
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:45,091
- <i>( Horse thuds )</i>
- Bring him back to me.

( Singing begins )

470
00:33:01,575 --> 00:33:03,476
What have you done?

471
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,811
I have to save him.

472
00:33:05,846 --> 00:33:08,981
We could have been 10 miles away from
here by now on the way to Asshai.

473
00:33:09,016 --> 00:33:11,217
- You would have been safe.

<i>Jíni'th vos eo.</i>

476
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:25,431
Mra qothoon vosaan--

477
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,835
- ( groaning )
- Khaleesi!

478
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,443
( Sobbing )

479
00:33:36,478 --> 00:33:38,979
<i>( Singing continues )</i>

480
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,444
Are you hurt?

481
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:16,945
- The baby...
- Hmm?

482
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,614
...Is coming.

483
00:34:18,648 --> 00:34:21,183
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come.

484
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:23,219
They say
she is cursed.

485
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:25,789
They'll come or I'll
have their heads.

486
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:29,559
The witch--
she can bring baby.

487
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:32,130
I hear her say so.

488
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:34,332
<i>( Singing,</i>
<i>demon shrieking continues )</i>

489
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:42,872
( Spits )

490
00:34:47,943 --> 00:34:50,544
<i>( Singing, shrieking</i>
<i>continues )</i>

491
00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:56,078
Shae: Are you in agony,
my lion?

492
00:34:56,112 --> 00:34:58,680
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

493
00:34:58,715 --> 00:35:02,083
The fire is burning
your pretty soft skin.

494
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:07,354
- Ahhh.
- ( Laughter )

495
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,791
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

496
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:14,026
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

497
00:35:16,062 --> 00:35:18,797
Let's play a new game.

498
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:21,932
There's a Braavosi knife game
I could teach you--

499
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:24,768
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

500
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:27,770
- Not if you win.
- No!

501
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:30,305
No more fire games,
no knife games.

502
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:33,241
Let's do something
I'm good at.

503
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:35,476
What are you good at?

504
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,477
I happen to be a great
judge of character.

505
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:39,912
- This sounds like a boring game.
- <i>It's not.</i>

506
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:42,715
<i>Here's how it works:</i>
<i>I make a statement</i>

507
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:45,184
about your past.
If I'm right,

508
00:35:45,218 --> 00:35:47,452
you drink.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

509
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:50,187
And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.

510
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:52,289
I don't want to play
this game.

511
00:35:52,323 --> 00:35:54,524
Fine.
Bronn first.

512
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:00,863
Your father beat you.

513
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:08,468
But my mother
hit harder.

514
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:14,407
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

515
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,342
It was a woman.

516
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:20,979
She swung
an axe at me.

517
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:24,315
You've been
North of the Wall.

518
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,453
What brought you
up there?

519
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:31,756
Work.

520
00:36:31,824 --> 00:36:33,825
And...

521
00:36:33,826 --> 00:36:35,894
You once loved a woman
many years ago,

522
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:39,197
but it turned out badly so you've
never let yourself love again.

523
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,434
Oh wait, that's me.

524
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:49,506
Your turn, my mysterious
foreign beauty.

525
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,375
I don't want to play.

526
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:55,279
It's fun!
Look at the fun we're having.

527
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,950
Your mother
was a whore.

528
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,787
Drink.

529
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,227
All right.

530
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,997
Your father left the family when
you were very young,

531
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,032
- never to return.
- Drink.

532
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,991
And we've established
the rules about lying?

533
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:20,216
Drink!

534
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,142
- ( Bronn pours )
- Mmmm.

535
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:29,378
You wanted
a different life.

536
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,547
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

537
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:35,150
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

538
00:37:35,184 --> 00:37:37,452
So specifics--

539
00:37:37,486 --> 00:37:40,689
you wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

540
00:37:40,723 --> 00:37:44,393
I don't believe the life
of the silent sisters is for you.

541
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:48,697
So what's
a lowborn girl to do?

542
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:54,302
Drink.

543
00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:59,007
- Are you sure--
- drink!

544
00:38:03,546 --> 00:38:07,216
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever

545
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:10,688
or I will carve your eyes
from your head.

546
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,260
My dear lady, if I have
offended you, I apologize.

547
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,461
My turn.

548
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:21,897
Fine fine.

549
00:38:21,931 --> 00:38:24,232
Ask away.

550
00:38:24,266 --> 00:38:27,335
Try to penetrate
the enigma that is me.

551
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:30,137
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

552
00:38:30,171 --> 00:38:32,505
I don't care the way
the game works.

553
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,641
Our Lord here
used to be married.

554
00:38:35,743 --> 00:38:37,744
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

555
00:38:37,778 --> 00:38:41,315
You hear lots of things playing
dice with Lannister soldiers.

556
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:45,053
Another night,
perhaps.

557
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:48,390
Not another night.
This night.

558
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,561
It's not
a pleasant story.

559
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,736
- Or maybe I will cry.
- I'm guessing the lady and I

560
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,506
can tell more unpleasant stories
than your Lordship.

561
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,173
So...

562
00:39:07,377 --> 00:39:10,980
I was 16. My brother Jaime
and I were riding

563
00:39:11,014 --> 00:39:14,716
when we heard a scream.
She ran out onto the road,

564
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,417
clothes half torn off
with two men on her heels.

565
00:39:17,452 --> 00:39:21,987
Jaime scared away the men easily
enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.

566
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:24,076
She was too scared to send off
on her own,

567
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,948
so while Jaime
hunted down the rapers

568
00:39:25,992 --> 00:39:29,127
I took her to the nearest
inn and fed her.

569
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:31,929
Her name was Tysha.

570
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:34,198
She was
a wheelwright's orphan.

571
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:36,366
And she was hungry--

572
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:39,803
together we finished off
three chickens and a flagon of wine.

573
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:43,238
Impossible as it seems, there was a
time when I was unaccustomed to wine.

574
00:39:43,273 --> 00:39:46,107
I forgot how afraid
I was around girls,

575
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:49,545
how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me

576
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:52,013
or look away embarrassed

577
00:39:52,048 --> 00:39:54,448
or ask me about my tall
handsome brother.

578
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:57,585
I forgot about
everything but Tysha.

579
00:39:58,853 --> 00:40:01,221
And somehow I found
myself in her bed.

580
00:40:01,255 --> 00:40:03,690
For three chickens,
I should hope so.

581
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:07,594
It didn't last long. I didn't know
what the hell I was doing.

582
00:40:07,629 --> 00:40:10,230
But she was good to me.

583
00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:12,366
She kissed me afterwards

584
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,302
and sang me a song.

585
00:40:15,336 --> 00:40:20,441
And by morning I was deep enough
in love to ask for her hand.

586
00:40:20,475 --> 00:40:23,177
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken Septon

587
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:25,613
and there you have it--
man and wife.

588
00:40:25,647 --> 00:40:29,250
For a fortnight anyway,
until the Septon sobered up

589
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:31,318
and told my father.

590
00:40:31,353 --> 00:40:34,321
I imagine that was
the end of all that.

591
00:40:34,355 --> 00:40:36,389
Not quite.

592
00:40:36,424 --> 00:40:40,027
First, my father had
Jaime tell me the truth.

593
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:44,164
The girl was a whore,
you see.

594
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,668
Jaime had arranged
the whole thing,

595
00:40:47,702 --> 00:40:50,537
the road, the rapers--
all of it.

596
00:40:50,572 --> 00:40:53,173
He thought it was time
I had a woman.

597
00:40:55,143 --> 00:40:57,311
<i>After my brother confessed,</i>

598
00:40:57,345 --> 00:41:00,647
my father brought in my wife

599
00:41:00,682 --> 00:41:03,450
and gave her
to his guards.

600
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:07,020
<i>He paid her well--</i>
<i>a silver for each man.</i>

601
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:10,023
How many whores command
that kind of price?

602
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:14,995
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

603
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:18,431
By the end,
she had so much silver

604
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:21,400
that the coins were
slipping through her fingers

605
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:24,236
and rolling
onto the floor.

606
00:41:26,974 --> 00:41:29,976
I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

607
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,246
You should have known
she was a whore.

608
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,581
( Chuckles )
Really?

609
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:38,451
I was 16, drunk
and in love--

610
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:40,386
A girl who
was almost raped

611
00:41:40,421 --> 00:41:43,389
doesn't invite another man
into her bed two hours later.

612
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:49,294
As I said, I was
young and stupid.

613
00:41:51,497 --> 00:41:53,932
You are still
young and stupid.

614
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:05,578
( Kissing )

615
00:42:11,016 --> 00:42:13,284
<i>( Hoofbeats )</i>

616
00:42:17,255 --> 00:42:19,456
Hyah!

617
00:42:26,097 --> 00:42:28,631
<i>( Horse neighs )</i>

618
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:31,468
<i>( Shouting, clamoring )</i>

619
00:42:35,673 --> 00:42:37,307
What is it?
What do you want?

620
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:39,176
You're sleeping
through the war.

621
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:42,112
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

622
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:44,380
They're a mile north.

623
00:42:44,415 --> 00:42:47,016
- <i>Get my squire!</i>
- You don't have a squire.

624
00:42:49,386 --> 00:42:51,720
If I die, weep for me.

625
00:42:52,955 --> 00:42:56,057
You'll be dead.
How will you know?

626
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:04,068
I'll know.

627
00:43:05,904 --> 00:43:07,771
Watch out!
Move!

628
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:10,374
Out of the way!

629
00:43:10,408 --> 00:43:12,777
- Move aside!
- ( Neighs

630
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:20,786
stay low.

631
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:22,922
Stay low?

632
00:43:22,956 --> 00:43:25,524
If you're lucky,
no one will notice you.

Hmph.
The scouts were wrong.

664
00:45:36,277 --> 00:45:40,313
There were 2,000
Stark bannermen, not 20,000.

665
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:43,483
Did we get the Stark boy,
at least?

He wasn't here.

667

With his other 18,000 men.

669

Give me my daughters back.

Give me my husband.

Theon: <i>Kill him, Robb.</i>

He cut down 10 of our men--
you saw him.

685

He's more use

Catelyn: Take him away
and put him in irons.

689

You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.

690

Swords or lances, teeth, nails--
choose your weapons

691

and let's end this
here and now.

692
00:47:37,977 --> 00:47:40,645
If we do it your way,
Kingslayer,

693
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,380
you'd win.

I sent 2,000 men

The bards will sing songs

Aye. But the dead
won't hear them.

700
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:18,346
One victory does not
make us conquerors.

701
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:22,917
Did we free my father?

702

Did we rescue my sisters
from the Queen?

703
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:31,026
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

704

A lemon one--

Three coppers.

How about
a nice fat pigeon?

711

Piss off now.
Go on.
