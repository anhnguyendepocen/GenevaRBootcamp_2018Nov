What do you remember?

11
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:22,192
They stabbed me.

12
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:28,482
Olly...

13
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:32,736
he put a knife in my heart.

14
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:40,961
I shouldn't be here.

15
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:45,249
The lady brought you back.

16
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:49,086
Afterwards, after they stabbed you,

17
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:51,338
after you died, where did you go?

18
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:53,390
What did you see?

19
00:03:57,847 --> 00:03:59,647
Nothing.

20
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:04,401
There was nothing at all.

21
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:11,492
The Lord let you
come back for a reason.

Stannis was not the prince

23
00:04:16,198 --> 00:04:17,781
but someone has to be.

24
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,505
Could you give us a moment?

25
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:47,611
You were dead.

26
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,396
And now you're not.

27
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,735
That's completely
fucking mad, seems to me.

28
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,287
I can only imagine
how it seems to you.

29
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,959
I did what I thought was right.

30
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,080
And I got murdered for it.

31
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:09,416
And now I'm back.

32
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:10,918
Why?

33
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:12,636
I don't know.

34
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:15,139
Maybe we'll never know.

35
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:17,224
What does it matter?

36
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:20,978
You go on.

37
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:25,265
You fight for as long as you can.

38
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:28,268
You clean up as much
of the shit as you can.

39
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:31,321
I don't know how to do that.

40
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,075
I thought I did, but...

41
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:40,864
I failed.

42
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:45,919
Good.

43
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:47,504

00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:49,183
The man who returned from the dead.

47
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:50,851
I'm not a god.

48
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:53,654
I know that.

49
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:57,157
I saw your pecker.

50
00:06:57,243 --> 00:07:00,160
What kind of god would
have a pecker that small?

51
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:03,413

55

Is that still you in there?

56
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,359
I think so.

57
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:37,564
Hold off on burning my body for now.

65
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:22,109
Yes.
Yes, I'm fine.

66
00:08:25,164 --> 00:08:28,916
Did I ever tell you I used to
think the sea was called the see

67
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:31,952
because it was nothing but water
as far as the eye could see?

68
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:33,337
I don't think so.

69
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:35,839
Sea, see.

70
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,759
They're spelled different,
but they sound the same.

71
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:41,845
Yeah, they do.

72
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:44,932
It was before I learned
how to read, obviously.

73
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:51,188
Sam, are you going to be sick?

74
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:08,655
Won't be long.
We'll be in the south soon.

75
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,824
I'm excited to see Oldtown.

76
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:16,413
Captain says it's the most
beautiful city in Westeros.

77
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,916
Are you going to vomit again?

78
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:22,219
No.
No, no, no.

79
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:26,506
The Citadel doesn't admit women.

80
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:29,676
There won't be a place for
you there or for Little Sam.

81
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:33,230
I stayed at Castle Black.
There's no women allowed there.

82
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:35,399
The Citadel isn't Castle Black.

83
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:38,902
I don't have a Jon Snow
or Maester Aemon

84
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:41,822
to help me bend the rules.

85
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:43,740
I'll stay in Oldtown, then.

86
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:45,525
By yourself?

87
00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:47,327
With a baby and no money?

88
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,697
So if we're not going to Oldtown,

89
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:51,948
where are you taking me?

90
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:55,702
To my home.

91
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:57,037
Horn Hill.

92
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,625
My father's--
well, my father,

93
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,295
but my mother's a kind woman
and my sister's lovely.

94
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:08,098
They'll take care of you both.

95
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:11,468
"Wherever you go,
I go, too."

96

<i>That's what you said.</i>

97
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:32,956
I said that because I want
you and Little Sam to be safe.

98
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:35,325
That's all I want--

99
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:38,962
to become a maester so I can
help Jon when the time comes

100
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:40,714
so you'll be safe.

101
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,416
Us and everyone else in the world.

102
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,634
I don't care about them.

103
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:48,638
Well, no, I do, but I don't really.

104
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:52,142
I care about you and him.

105
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,596
I know that, Sam.

106
00:10:56,732 --> 00:10:58,932
And he does, too.

107
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:04,237
You're the only one who ever has.

108
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:15,449
If you think it's for the best,

109
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:18,168
we trust you.

110
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:21,171
I'd feel better if you threw
something at me and stormed off.

111
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,758
I'd never do that
to the father of my son.

The Sword of the Morning.

Father said he was the best
swordsman he ever saw.

Lord Stark.

123
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:07,060
I looked for you on the Trident.

124
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:09,145
We weren't there.

125
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:10,814
Your friend the usurper

126
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,900
would lie beneath the
ground if we had been.

Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.

Why weren't you there
to protect your prince?

130
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:22,709
Our prince wanted us here.

131
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:32,085
Where's my sister?

132
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,390
I wish you good fortune
in the wars to come.

133
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:46,850
And now it begins.

134
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:53,440
No.

135
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:55,492

Far better.

143
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,383
But Father beat him.

144

Did he?

145
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:47,637
I know he did.

146
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:49,389
Heard the story a thousand times.

(grunts)

148
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:09,325
He stabbed him in the back.

No.

160

- Maybe.

to an old man in a tree?</i>

170
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:39,549
You think I wanted to sit
here for 1,000 years

171
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:41,501
watching the world from a distance

172
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:43,002
as the roots grew through me?

173
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:44,804
So why did you?

174
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:47,674
I was waiting for you.

175
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,559
I don't want to be you.

176
00:17:49,678 --> 00:17:52,312
(laughs)
I don't blame you.

177
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:55,849
You won't be here forever.

178
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:58,568
You won't be an old man in a tree.

179
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:01,104
<i>But before you leave,</i>

180
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:04,190
you must learn.

181
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:06,109
Learn what?

182
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:08,828
Everything.

183
00:18:10,365 --> 00:18:12,365
(chatter)

184
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:33,321

185
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,428

186
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,910
_

187
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:48,944
_

188
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,348
_

189
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:52,468
_

190
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,889
_

191
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:16,723
_

192
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:18,872
_

193
00:20:18,992 --> 00:20:20,619

194

195
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:29,151

196
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,672
_

197
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:35,500
_

198
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,673
_

199
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:39,965
_

200
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:44,745
_

201
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:51,939
_

202
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:55,308
_

203
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:01,807
_

204
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,246
_

205
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:08,577
_

206
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:10,869
_

207
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:14,415
_

208
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:16,956
_

209
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:19,428
_

210
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:23,582
_

211
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:27,367
_

212
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:32,009
_

213
00:21:33,453 --> 00:21:38,775
_

214
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:42,525
_

215
00:21:43,272 --> 00:21:46,980
_

216
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,996
_

217
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:05,314
I don't know how you stand
it in all that leather.

218
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,407
If we could have the room.

219
00:22:24,836 --> 00:22:27,537
You look lovely today, my dear.
You really do.

220
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:32,008
How you climbed all those steps
without breaking a sweat.

221
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:33,327
If you're going to torture me,

222
00:22:33,378 --> 00:22:35,461
just call them back
and get on with it.

223
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:37,630
I am not a torturer.

224
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,518
Though it so often is
what people deserve.

225
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:46,472
And it does provide answers.

226
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,442
But they're usually
the wrong answers.

227
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:53,029
My job is to find the right answers.

228
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:55,231
Do you know how I do that?

229
00:22:55,316 --> 00:22:58,618
I do it by making people happy.

230
00:22:58,703 --> 00:23:01,320
I'd like to make you happy, Vala.

231
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:04,657
That's your name, isn't it, Vala?

232
00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:07,043
(chuckles)
That's all right.

233
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:10,296
I know who you are
and what you've done.

234
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:13,466
You've done a lot.

235
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:16,002
You've sacrificed
your body for a cause,

236
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:19,472
which is more than most people do.

237
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:22,675
And you've helped
the Sons of the Harpy

238
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,511
murder the Unsullied
and the Second Sons.

239
00:23:25,647 --> 00:23:28,981
The Unsullied and the Second
Sons are foreign soldiers

240
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:31,100
brought here by a foreign queen

241
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:33,903
to destroy our city and our history.

242
00:23:34,022 --> 00:23:36,856
I understand.

243
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:39,609
Well, that makes perfect sense

244
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:42,445
from your perspective.

245
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,332
I have a different
perspective, of course.

246
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:49,869
I think it's important that you try
to see things from my perspective

247
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:52,371
just as I will try
to see them from yours.

248
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:54,674
Because that is the only way

249
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:57,677
that I can make you and Dom happy.

250
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:04,550
That is how
you pronounce it-- Dom?

251
00:24:04,686 --> 00:24:07,687
I'm afraid I don't really
speak the language.

252
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:11,107
Such a handsome boy.

253
00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:14,727
Those big, brown eyes. Good
luck keeping the ladies away.

254
00:24:14,863 --> 00:24:18,981
Yes, you're a true
liberator, aren't you?

255
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,951
You won't torture me,
you'll just threaten my son.

256
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,487
Children are blameless.

257
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,740
I have never hurt them.

258
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:30,159
Your boy is in no immediate danger,

259
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:31,827
this I swear to you.

260
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:35,715
But between us, dear,

261
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,918
you did conspire to kill
the queen's soldiers.

262
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:41,587
We both know the penalty
for that crime.

263
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:50,396
How will poor Dom
get on without his mother?

264
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,515
And with his breathing problem.

265
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,934
If I tell you anything,
they'll kill me.

266
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,236
So either you kill me or they do.

267
00:24:57,322 --> 00:25:00,856
Yes, from your perspective,
this is a problem.

268
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,443
There is a third option, though.

269
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:07,747
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

270
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:12,451
I've already booked passage for
a woman and her young son.

271
00:25:12,587 --> 00:25:16,005
I'll even throw in a bag of
silver to help you start again.

272
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:17,873
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask

273
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:21,677
one of our leather-clad
friends back in to carry it.

274
00:25:21,796 --> 00:25:23,462
Far too heavy for me.

275
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:26,716
The boat sails at dawn.

276
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:29,602
You need to decide now.

277
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:32,471
A new life for you and Dom

278
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:34,190
or...

279
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:52,041
What should we do while we wait?

280
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,960
To pass the time, what should we do?

281
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:56,379
<i>What should we talk about?</i>

282
00:25:58,716 --> 00:26:00,499
You speak 19 languages.

283
00:26:00,585 --> 00:26:03,919
You must occasionally use some
of them to talk about things.

284
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:07,256
You two, you spend a great
deal of time together.

285
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:10,509
What would you be talking
about if I weren't here?

286
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:13,562
Patrol.

287
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:16,315
When I am going on patrol
with the Unsullied.

288
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,985
What we see on patrol.

289
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,020
Who we captured on patrol.

290
00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:23,572
That's good.
That's very good.

291
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:28,077
But that's a report.

292
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:30,363
I was thinking more
of a conversation.

293
00:26:30,498 --> 00:26:33,532
A wise man once said the
true history of the world

294
00:26:33,618 --> 00:26:37,036
is the history of great
conversations in elegant rooms.

295
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:39,038
Who said this?

296
00:26:39,123 --> 00:26:41,507
Me.

297
00:26:41,592 --> 00:26:43,542
Just now.

298
00:26:49,884 --> 00:26:52,134
All right, no conversations.

299
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,103
Let's play a game.

300
00:26:56,974 --> 00:26:58,774
You don't play games,
either one of you, ever?

301
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,059
Games are for children.

302
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:01,811
Missandei:
<i>My master Kraznys</i>

303
00:27:01,896 --> 00:27:04,063
would sometimes make us play games.

304
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:05,898
There, that's a start.

305
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:09,702
- Only the girls.
- No, no, no.

306
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:11,737
Not that.
Of course not that.

307
00:27:13,124 --> 00:27:15,374
Innocent games.
Fun games.

308
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,959
Drinking games.

309
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:19,245
Missandei:
<i>We do not drink.</i>

310
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,380
Until you do.

311
00:27:23,084 --> 00:27:25,251
All right.
No drinking.

312
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:26,886
We can play without drinking.

313
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:29,138
It's a wonderful game.
I invented it.

314
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:30,756
Here's how it works.

315
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:32,808
I make a statement about your past.

316
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,560
If I'm wrong, I drink.

317
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:37,763
And if I'm right--

318
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:41,267
maybe we can't play without drinking.

319
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:42,935
<i>(door opens)</i>

320
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,488
Oh, you took your time.

321
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:47,573
Sorry.

322
00:27:47,658 --> 00:27:51,277
I was busy learning who funds
the Sons of the Harpy.

323
00:27:51,412 --> 00:27:53,446
- Some things you can't rush.
- You found out?

324
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:55,664
The Good Masters of Astapor

325
00:27:55,783 --> 00:27:57,950
and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.

326
00:27:58,035 --> 00:28:01,036
With help from their
friends in Volantis.

327
00:28:01,122 --> 00:28:02,588
Tyrion:
<i>You see?</i>

328
00:28:02,673 --> 00:28:05,174
You don't even have to worry
about the local rebellion.

329
00:28:05,293 --> 00:28:06,792
We only have to worry about

330
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:09,128
the three rich foreign
cities paying for it.

331
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:10,846
We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.

332
00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:12,798
We will do it again
and execute the Masters.

333
00:28:12,884 --> 00:28:16,302
If the Unsullied march off to
reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,

334
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:17,887
who will remain to defend
the free people of Meereen?

335
00:28:17,972 --> 00:28:20,523
If we do not fight them,
how can we stop them?

336
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:22,308
We cannot.

337
00:28:22,443 --> 00:28:25,194
The Masters speak only one language.

338
00:28:25,313 --> 00:28:26,979
They spoke it to me for many years.

339
00:28:27,064 --> 00:28:28,814
<i>I know it better
than my mother tongue.</i>

340
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,618
If we want them to hear us, we
must speak it back to them.

341
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:34,870
May it be the last
thing they ever hear.

342
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:37,039
You may be right.

343
00:28:37,158 --> 00:28:39,125
Grey Worm:
<i>So we will fight them?</i>

344
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,160
- Possibly.
- Possibly?

345
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:44,163
It's a conversation.

346
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:46,549
Tell me, can your little
birds get a message

347
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,885
to the Good Masters of Astapor,
the Wise Masters of Yunkai,

348
00:28:50,004 --> 00:28:52,555
and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?

349
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:55,307
Of course.
Men can be fickle,

350
00:28:55,393 --> 00:28:58,511
but birds I always trust.

351
00:28:58,646 --> 00:29:00,930
(children chatting quietly)

352
00:29:04,852 --> 00:29:07,736
Your eye looks much better, Arthur.

353
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:09,188
How's your mother's jaw?

354
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:10,823
Better.

355
00:29:10,908 --> 00:29:12,241
And your father?

356
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,827
No one's seen him.

357
00:29:14,912 --> 00:29:16,195
And no one will.

358
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,913
That worked out rather nicely.

359
00:29:18,032 --> 00:29:20,032
Will Lord Varys ever come back?

360
00:29:20,168 --> 00:29:22,201
I don't think so.

361
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:24,119
Do you miss him?

362
00:29:24,205 --> 00:29:26,789
He was nice.

363
00:29:26,874 --> 00:29:29,208
He called us his little birds.

364
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:30,876
He gave us sweets.

365
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,848
It's funny you should mention that.

366
00:29:37,602 --> 00:29:41,554
Guess what I happened to find today.

367
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:45,224
Candied plums from Dorne.

368
00:29:46,611 --> 00:29:48,694
(laughing)

369
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:50,896
Now remember, if any of your friends

370
00:29:51,032 --> 00:29:54,233
like sweets or need help,
they can always come to me.

371
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:58,737
All I need in return are whispers.

372
00:29:58,873 --> 00:30:01,123
<i>(door opens)</i>

373
00:30:06,214 --> 00:30:07,997
Qyburn:
<i>No need to be afraid.</i>

374
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:09,999
This is Ser Gregor.

375
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:12,334
He's friends with all my friends.

376
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:19,892
Run along now.

377
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:26,565
Varys's little birds?

378
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:28,150
Your little birds now, Your Grace.

379
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:30,185
What did you do to him exactly?

380
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:31,937
I haven't been able
to get a clear answer.

381
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:34,106
Oh, a number of things.

382
00:30:34,191 --> 00:30:35,691
Does he understand what we're saying?

383
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,027
I mean, to the extent
that he ever understood

384
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:40,362
complete sentences
in the first place.

385
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:44,250
He understands well enough.

386
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:46,368
So tell him to march into the sept

387
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:49,088
and crush the High Sparrow's
head like a melon.

388
00:30:49,173 --> 00:30:52,591
The High Sparrow has hundreds of
Faith Militant surrounding him.

389
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:54,960
Ser Gregor can't face them all.

390
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:56,962
And he won't have to.

391
00:30:57,098 --> 00:30:59,098
He'll only have to face one.

392
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:03,636
Has the Faith leveled
official charges yet?

393
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:05,387
Not yet.

394
00:31:05,473 --> 00:31:08,641
That is one trial by combat
I look forward to watching.

395
00:31:08,776 --> 00:31:10,643
Don't stop at the city.

396
00:31:10,778 --> 00:31:13,062
I want little birds in Dorne,

397
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:15,814
in Highgarden, in the North.

398
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,984
If someone is planning on
making our losses their gains,

399
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,953
I want to hear it.

400
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:23,656
If someone is laughing at the queen

401
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:26,375
who walked naked through
the streets covered in shit,

402
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:28,243
I want to hear.

403
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:31,130
I want to know who they are.

404
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:33,332
I want to know where they are.

405
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,558
Pycelle: <i>As bad as Lord
Varys was, Qyburn is worse.</i>

406
00:31:42,677 --> 00:31:45,060
I told them all.
I told them.

407
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,062
He's arrogant, dangerous.

408
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:50,182
You don't get thrown out of the
Citadel without good reason.

409
00:31:50,318 --> 00:31:52,017
- And no one listened to my advice.
- <i>(door opens)</i>

410
00:31:52,153 --> 00:31:54,236
<i>So here we are.</i>

411
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:56,655
And what he's done to Gregor Clegane

412
00:31:56,741 --> 00:31:58,691
<i>is an abomination.</i>

413
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:01,860
We never sanctioned this experiment.

414
00:32:01,996 --> 00:32:04,530
I for one think it will
be in our best interest

415
00:32:04,665 --> 00:32:06,332
to have the beast dest--

416
00:32:09,587 --> 00:32:11,086
<i>(farts)</i>

417
00:32:11,205 --> 00:32:13,706
- Can I help you?
- Why are you here?

418
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:16,208
- My mother--
- I was invited, my dear,

419
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:18,961
to help deal with several
troublesome issues,

420
00:32:19,046 --> 00:32:21,380
such as the queen's imprisonment.

421
00:32:21,465 --> 00:32:23,882
Thank you for bringing it up.

422
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:27,720
It's well past time we addressed
the abuses I endured.

423
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:30,022
Margaery is the queen.

424
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:31,890
You are not the queen

425
00:32:31,976 --> 00:32:34,026
<i>because you're not
married to the king.</i>

426
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:35,811
I do appreciate these things

427
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:39,531
can get a bit confusing
in your family.

428
00:32:39,617 --> 00:32:41,784
This is a small council meeting.

429
00:32:41,902 --> 00:32:44,036
You have no position
on the small council.

430
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:45,904
I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

431
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,430
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

432
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:49,241
does have a position
on the small council.

433
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:51,910
Grand Maester Pycelle, would
you sanction that statement?

434
00:32:51,996 --> 00:32:54,079
Well, um...

435
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:57,166
I would say Ser Gerold Hightower

436
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:59,334
had a seat on the Mad King's council.

437
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,004
<i>Of course, that was the Mad King.</i>

438
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,722
King Robert saw things differently.

439
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:05,507
- And King--
- (loud thud)

440
00:33:08,813 --> 00:33:11,647
What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?

441
00:33:11,766 --> 00:33:13,932
Do you consider the
murder of your own blood

442
00:33:14,018 --> 00:33:16,018
a troublesome issue?

443
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:17,936
The same women who murdered Myrcella

444
00:33:18,072 --> 00:33:20,522
have overthrown House Martell
and taken control of Dorne.

445
00:33:20,608 --> 00:33:22,324
We've got a lot to discuss.

446
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:24,827
All of us together.

447
00:33:24,945 --> 00:33:28,614
And seeing as you cannot make us
leave, we best get on with it.

448
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:33,285
No, we cannot make you leave.

449
00:33:33,421 --> 00:33:36,505
And you cannot make us stay.

450
00:33:36,624 --> 00:33:40,209
Not unless you're gonna have
that thing murder us all.

451
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:08,403
<i>- (door opens)
- (armor rattling)</i>

452
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:23,418
(groans)
Your Grace.

453
00:34:23,504 --> 00:34:26,672
My mother would like to see her
daughter's final resting place.

454
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:29,341
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

455
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:31,343
That's not possible.
Not yet.

456
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:33,095
When will it be possible?

457
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,514
When she's fully atoned for her sins.

458
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:38,183
You cut off her hair
and marched her naked

459
00:34:38,269 --> 00:34:40,686
through the streets
in front of the whole city.

460
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:42,488
That wasn't the full atonement?

461
00:34:42,573 --> 00:34:44,356
No.

462
00:34:44,408 --> 00:34:47,576
She must stand trial
before seven septons

463
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:49,828
so we can learn the true
extent of her sins.

464
00:34:49,914 --> 00:34:54,082
I want you to let her see
Myrcella's resting place.

465
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:55,751
I am the king.

466
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,336
You are.

467
00:34:59,373 --> 00:35:01,206
And what does that mean to you?

468
00:35:01,342 --> 00:35:02,708
<i>It means a great deal to me.</i>

469
00:35:02,793 --> 00:35:04,710
The Crown and the Faith

470
00:35:04,795 --> 00:35:06,929
are the twin pillars of the world.

471
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:09,047
<i>Do you know who told me that?</i>

472
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:11,767
Your mother.

473
00:35:11,886 --> 00:35:14,386
My mother who is unclean?

474
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:18,440
My mother who still needs to atone
after all you've put her through?

475
00:35:37,161 --> 00:35:40,462
How do you think the Mother
Above first came to us?

476
00:35:41,465 --> 00:35:43,248
How did men and women

477
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:46,835
first come to feel
the Mother's presence, hmm?

478
00:35:48,255 --> 00:35:50,055
It was through their own mothers.

479
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,144
There's a great deal of falsehood
in Cersei. You know that.

480
00:35:56,263 --> 00:36:00,432
But when she speaks of you, the
Mother's love outshines it all.

481
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:05,437
Her love for you is more real

482
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:07,439
than anything else in this world

483
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:10,525
because it doesn't
come from this world.

484
00:36:10,611 --> 00:36:12,578
But you know that.

485
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:15,280
You've felt it.

486
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:17,583
You've seen her
when she talks to you.

487
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,453
Yes.

488
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:23,755
<i>It's a great gift.</i>

489
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:25,841
One I never had.

490
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,461
Envy.

491
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:32,014
One more thing for me to atone for.

492
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:35,350
Your Grace,
do you-- may I?

493
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:37,019
Do you mind?

494
00:36:37,137 --> 00:36:38,470
It's my knees.

495
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:40,439
Of course.

496
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:49,648
When your mother
made her walk of atonement,

497
00:36:49,783 --> 00:36:51,984
she did it to get back to you.

498
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:54,820
I still don't understand
why you want to put her

499
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:56,705
through any more than
she's already endured.

500
00:36:56,824 --> 00:37:00,158
It's not what I want.
It's what the gods want.

501
00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:02,878
<i>They make their will known
to us and it's up to us</i>

502
00:37:02,997 --> 00:37:05,414
to either accept or reject it.

503
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,167
Please.

504
00:37:14,508 --> 00:37:17,726
If we're to be just and good,

505
00:37:17,845 --> 00:37:20,562
then we accept it,
all of us, even kings.

506
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:24,933
A true leader avails himself
of the wisest counsel he can.

507
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:27,486
And no one is wiser than the gods.

508
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:33,191
My grandfather once said
something similar.

509
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:35,160
Except for the part about the gods.

510
00:37:35,245 --> 00:37:39,164
The gods worked through him
whether he knew it or not.

511
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:42,451
As they work through your mother.

512
00:37:44,705 --> 00:37:46,755
There's so much good in all of us.

513
00:37:46,874 --> 00:37:50,542
The best we can do is to help
each other bring it out.

514
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:07,476
(gasps)

515
00:38:11,398 --> 00:38:12,647
(gasps)

516
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:20,572
Who are you?

517
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:22,074
No one.

518
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,875
(grunts)

519
00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:26,461
Waif: <i>Who were you
before you came here?</i>

520
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,213
Arya:
<i>Arya Stark.</i>

521
00:38:28,298 --> 00:38:30,082
(grunts)

522
00:38:30,217 --> 00:38:32,751
Waif: <i>Tell me about
Arya Stark's family.</i>

523
00:38:32,886 --> 00:38:35,754
Her father was Eddard Stark.

524
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,390
Her mother was Catelyn Stark.

525
00:38:38,475 --> 00:38:41,810
She had one sister, Sansa,

526
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:43,812
and four brothers.

527
00:38:47,985 --> 00:38:50,485
(panting)

528
00:38:53,524 --> 00:38:55,273
Three brothers.

529
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:58,193
<i>Robb, Bran, Rickon.</i>

530
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:03,081
And a half-brother Jon.

531
00:39:04,251 --> 00:39:06,585
And where are they now?

532
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,621
Arya: <i>They may be dead
for all a girl knows.</i>

533
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:13,708
(sniffs)

534
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:19,798
(sniffs)

535
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:21,349
Tell me about the Hound.

536
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,970
Arya:
<i>Also dead.</i>

537
00:39:35,149 --> 00:39:38,366
<i>Arya Stark left him to die.
He was on her list.</i>

538
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:43,955
He was not on her list anymore.

539
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:45,791
She had taken him off it.

540
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:49,961
Why? Didn't she want
him dead any longer?

541
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:56,051
Arya:
<i>She did and she did not.</i>

542
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:02,674
She sounds confused.

543
00:40:07,347 --> 00:40:11,183
Yes, she was.

544
00:40:15,405 --> 00:40:18,156
Who else was on Arya
Stark's funny little list?

545
00:40:18,242 --> 00:40:21,243
- (groans)
- Arya:<i> Cersei Lannister.</i>

546
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,995
<i>Gregor Clegane.</i>

547
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,332
<i>Walder Frey.</i>

548
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:29,251
<i>(rustling)</i>

549
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:33,839
Waif:
<i>That's a short list.</i>

550
00:40:33,924 --> 00:40:35,924
(panting)

551
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:40,345
<i>That can't be everyone
you want to kill.</i>

552
00:40:43,016 --> 00:40:45,634
Are you sure you're not
forgetting someone?

553
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:51,723
Which name would you
like a girl to speak?

554
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,984
(shouts)

555
00:41:27,678 --> 00:41:29,811
Jaqen: <i>If a girl tells me her name,</i>

556
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:32,314
I will give her eyes back.

557
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:37,235
A girl has no name.

558
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:41,941
Come.

559
00:42:15,475 --> 00:42:17,642
If a girl is truly no one,

560
00:42:17,728 --> 00:42:20,145
<i>she has nothing to fear.</i>

561
00:42:45,505 --> 00:42:47,639
Who are you?

562
00:42:51,011 --> 00:42:52,894
No one.

563
00:42:56,433 --> 00:42:58,233
(horse whinnies)

564
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:05,607
The Umbers are
a famously loyal house.

565
00:43:05,692 --> 00:43:08,193
Famously loyal to the Starks.

566
00:43:08,278 --> 00:43:11,329
And you, Lord Karstark.

567
00:43:11,415 --> 00:43:14,199
Your people share blood with
the Starks, don't they?

568
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:16,951
But here we are.
Times change.

569
00:43:17,037 --> 00:43:19,371
When my father became
Warden of the North,

570
00:43:19,456 --> 00:43:21,456
<i>your house refused
to pledge their banners.</i>

571
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:23,341
Your father was a cunt.

572
00:43:26,546 --> 00:43:28,763
My beloved father,
the Warden--

573
00:43:28,882 --> 00:43:32,017
Your father was a cunt
and that's why you killed him.

574
00:43:32,102 --> 00:43:34,936
<i>I might have done
the same to my father</i>

575
00:43:35,055 --> 00:43:37,605
if he hadn't have done me
the favor of dying on his own.

576
00:43:37,724 --> 00:43:40,525
My father was poisoned
by our enemies.

577
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,360
Mmm.

578
00:43:42,446 --> 00:43:45,730
Why have you come to
Winterfell, Lord Umber?

579
00:43:45,866 --> 00:43:49,701
The bastard Jon Snow led an army
of wildlings past the Wall.

580
00:43:49,786 --> 00:43:52,203
We're farther north
than any of you fuckers.

581
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:55,573
<i>Wildlings come down, we always
have to fight them first.</i>

582
00:43:55,659 --> 00:43:58,910
I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all my life.

583
00:43:58,995 --> 00:44:01,746
But there are too many of them
for us to beat back alone.

584
00:44:01,832 --> 00:44:04,716
So now you've come seeking help?

585
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:07,135
We need to help each other.

586
00:44:07,254 --> 00:44:10,805
The colder it gets, the farther
south those goat fuckers will roam.

587
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:12,891
Won't take them long to get here.

588
00:44:12,976 --> 00:44:15,810
You think a horde of wildlings
can take Winterfell?

589
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:17,529
If they get Jon Snow
leading them, maybe.

590
00:44:17,597 --> 00:44:20,065
<i>He knows this place
better than we ever will.</i>

591
00:44:23,186 --> 00:44:25,320
Pledge your banners to House Bolton.

592
00:44:25,439 --> 00:44:27,939
Swear loyalty to me
as Warden of the North

593
00:44:28,075 --> 00:44:30,575
and we will fight together
to destroy the bastard

594
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,160
and all his wildling friends.

595
00:44:32,279 --> 00:44:34,446
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

596
00:44:34,581 --> 00:44:37,165
Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

597
00:44:37,284 --> 00:44:39,284
I'm not doing that either.

598
00:44:39,419 --> 00:44:42,337
Why would I trust a man
who won't honor tradition?

599
00:44:42,456 --> 00:44:45,290
Your father honored tradition.

600
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:47,592
<i>Knelt for Robb Stark.</i>

601
00:44:47,677 --> 00:44:50,095
Called him King of the North.

602
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,347
<i>Was Robb Stark right
to trust your father?</i>

603
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:54,265
Then it appears we're
at a bit of an impasse.

604
00:44:54,351 --> 00:44:57,469
Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.

605
00:44:57,604 --> 00:44:59,187
I've got a gift for you.

606
00:45:02,142 --> 00:45:04,893
A girl, I hope.
I prefer redheads.

607
00:45:04,978 --> 00:45:07,979
A girl, aye.

608
00:45:08,064 --> 00:45:09,230
(laughing)

609
00:45:09,316 --> 00:45:11,366
<i>A wild one.</i>

610
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:20,875
I like them wild.

611
00:45:21,962 --> 00:45:25,463
And the boy, nice and young.

612
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:27,715
The way Karstark likes them.

613
00:45:33,507 --> 00:45:35,006
Who's this?

614
00:45:35,091 --> 00:45:37,475
Rickon Stark.

615
00:45:44,568 --> 00:45:46,851
How do I know that's Rickon Stark?

616
00:46:17,551 --> 00:46:20,385
Welcome home, Lord Stark.

617
00:46:24,524 --> 00:46:26,474
<i>(pounding on door)</i>

618
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:33,615
It's time.

619
00:47:11,021 --> 00:47:14,105
If you have any last
words, now is the time.

620
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:16,491
You shouldn't be alive.

621
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,526
It's not right.

622
00:47:19,696 --> 00:47:21,496
Neither was killing me.

623
00:47:25,835 --> 00:47:28,453
My mother's still
living at White Harbor.

624
00:47:28,588 --> 00:47:30,455
Could you write her?

625
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,874
Tell her I died
fighting the wildlings.

626
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:45,019
I had a choice, Lord Commander.

627
00:47:45,138 --> 00:47:49,107
Betray you or betray
the Night's Watch.

628
00:47:49,192 --> 00:47:52,277
You brought an army of
wildlings into our lands.

629
00:47:54,147 --> 00:47:56,981
An army of murderers and raiders.

630
00:47:57,117 --> 00:48:00,818
If I had to do it all over
knowing where I'd end up,

631
00:48:00,904 --> 00:48:04,322
I pray I'd make
the right choice again.

632
00:48:04,457 --> 00:48:06,491
I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.

633
00:48:06,576 --> 00:48:09,577
I fought, I lost.

634
00:48:11,414 --> 00:48:13,331
Now I rest.

635
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:18,252
But you, Lord Snow,

636
00:48:18,338 --> 00:48:20,755
you'll be fighting
their battles forever.

637
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:24,235
(choking, gasping)

638
00:50:07,947 --> 00:50:09,864
We should burn the bodies.

639
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:12,867
You should.

640
00:50:21,628 --> 00:50:23,928
What do you want me to do with this?

641
00:50:24,013 --> 00:50:25,713
Wear it.

642
00:50:25,799 --> 00:50:28,132
Burn it.

643
00:50:28,218 --> 00:50:30,435
Whatever you want.

644
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,019
You have Castle Black.

645
00:50:38,812 --> 00:50:41,028
My watch is ended.

646
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:56,189
