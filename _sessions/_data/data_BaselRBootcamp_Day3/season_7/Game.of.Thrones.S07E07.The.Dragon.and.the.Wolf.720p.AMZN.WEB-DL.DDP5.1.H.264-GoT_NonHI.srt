1
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:11,004
Little Theon! Come and get her.

2
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:22,629
It's an invitation...
to King's Landing.

3
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,129
You will represent my interests

4
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:25,754
at this gathering
as you see them.

5
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:28,213
It's not safe leaving you
with Littlefinger.

6
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,921
She's your sister.

7
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:31,712
Arya would never betray
her family.

8
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,338
She would if she thought
I was going to betray Jon.

9
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:39,629
With the faces,
I can become someone else.

10
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:44,213
I wonder what it would feel like
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

11
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,088
All I'd need to find out...
is your face.

12
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:55,046
Daenerys will win this war.

13
00:00:55,046 --> 00:00:56,504
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

14
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:57,504
you can ask her yourself.

15
00:00:57,504 --> 00:00:59,545
She has
a more important request.

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,088
Cersei thinks the army
of the dead is nothing

17
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:04,379
but a story.
What if we prove her wrong?

18
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,545
Bring the dead to her.

19
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:13,796
Go!

20
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:22,420
We are going to destroy
the Night King and his army.

21
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:24,754
Thank you, my queen.

22
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:25,962
-Oil?
- Pitch, my lord.

23
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:28,504
- How many barrels?
- 500, my lord.

24
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,587
Get 500 more.

25
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:33,587
Yes, my lord.

26
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:49,004
I still enjoy it
when they call me "my lord."

27
00:04:49,004 --> 00:04:51,462
The thrill will fade.

28
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:52,962
If we live that long.

29
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,171
Men without cocks.

30
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,879
You wouldn't find me
fighting in an army

31
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,837
if I had no cock.

32
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:02,296
What's left
to fight for?

33
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:04,171
Gold?

34
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,004
I spent my life
around soldiers.

35
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:08,129
What do you think
they spend that gold on?

36
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,338
Family.

37
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:13,004
Not without a cock,
you don't.

38
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:17,171
Maybe it really is
all cocks in the end.

39
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:22,545
Yet, your brother
has chosen to side
with the cockless.

40
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:27,420
Yes, he's always been
a champion of the downtrodden.

41
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:32,837
-

42
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:08,379
I think we're about to be
the downtrodden.

43
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:12,796
Archers, stand tall!

44
00:06:12,796 --> 00:06:15,754
-
- Man #Cover that wall!

45
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:46,796
- How many people live here?
- A million, give or take.

46
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:50,921
That's more people
than the entire North
crammed into that.

47
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:53,088
Why would anyone
want to live that way?

48
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,545
There's more work
in the city.

49
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:57,754
And the brothels
are far superior.

50
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,129
Why isn't she with them?

51
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,296
I'm afraid I don't know,
Your Grace.

52
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:42,462
No one has seen her.

53
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,129
And the rest of them?

54
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,379
They're on their way
to the Dragonpit now.

55
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:47,670
Including our brother?

56
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:50,462
Yes, Your Grace.

57
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:56,296
If anything goes wrong,

58
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:58,338
kill the silver-haired
bitch first,

59
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:01,629
then our brother,
then the bastard who
calls himself king.

60
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,670
The rest of them you can kill
in any order you see fit.

61
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:07,462
Come, Ser Gregor.

62
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:09,629
It's time for us
to meet our guests.

63
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,545
Why did they build it?

64
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:22,171
Dragons don't understand
the difference

65
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:24,379
between what is theirs
and what isn't.

66
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,046
Land, livestock,
children...

67
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:30,587
Letting them roam free
around a city was a problem.

68
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:34,379
I imagine it was
a sad joke at the end.

69
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,837
An entire arena
for a few sickly creatures
smaller than dogs.

70
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:41,338
But in the beginning,
when it was home to
Balerion the Dread,

71
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:44,712
it must have been
the most dangerous
place in the world.

72
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:53,046
Maybe it still is.

73
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:03,046
Welcome, my lords.

74
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,088
Your friends arrived
before you did.

75
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:11,962
I've been sent
to escort you all
to the meeting.

76
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,420
A pleasant surprise
in an unpleasant situation.

77
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,088
I never thought
I'd see you again,
my lord.

78
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,629
Supporting the enemy,
no less.

79
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:45,379
- Hard to blame you.
- Cersei will anyway.

80
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,088
I'm glad you're alive.

81
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,338
Come on!

82
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,796
You can suck
his magic cock later.

83
00:09:58,462 --> 00:09:59,837
What's in there?

84
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,629
Fuck off.

85
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:13,962
I thought
you were dead.

86
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:16,129
Not yet.

87
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:18,462
You came pretty close.

88
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:22,420
I was only trying
to protect her.

89
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:25,712
You and me both.

90
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,629
She's alive.

91
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:28,796
Arya.

92
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:33,670
- Where?
- Winterfell.

93
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,670
Who's protecting her
if you're here?

94
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,171
The only one
that needs protecting

95
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:42,504
is the one that gets
in her way.

96
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,046
It won't be me.

97
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:52,254
Here we are--

98
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:54,796
the heroes
of Blackwater Bay.

99
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:56,379
Strange place
for a reunion.

100
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:58,254
It is, my lord.

101
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:01,338
I don't think
I'm anyone's lord
anymore, Podrick.

102
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:03,921
Save the titles for
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

103
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:06,837
I'm sure your new queen
will be happy to
restore yours

104
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:08,296
if she ends up
on the throne.

105
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:10,420
You've been thinking
about our new queen?

106
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,754
Perhaps you've
been reconsidering
your allegiances.

107
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,796
Remember my offer--

108
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:20,213
whatever
they're paying you,
I'll pay double.

109
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,754
And that would be
double what now, exactly?

110
00:11:22,754 --> 00:11:25,296
Don't you worry about me.
I'm doing all right.

111
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:27,629
- Looking after myself.
-Are you?

112
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:29,088
Helping me to arrange
this meeting

113
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,545
wasn't exactly looking
after yourself, was it?

114
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:33,338
You put yourself
at risk.

115
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:36,213
I put yourself at risk.
Important difference.

116
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:39,712
It's your head Queen Cersei's
offered a bag of gold for,
it's not mine.

117
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:41,504
Now, thanks to me,

118
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:44,712
she's got two traitors' heads
coming right through her door.

119
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:47,171
She can lop them both off
as soon as she gets tired

120
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:50,046
of the clever words that
pour out their pieholes.

121
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:53,254
All thanks to Ser Bronn
of the fucking Blackwater.

122
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,545
If that's not
looking after myself,
I don't know what is.

123
00:11:58,254 --> 00:11:59,587
It's good
to see you again.

124
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:04,046
Yeah, you, too.

125
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:16,754
Anyone touches it,
I'll kill you first.

126
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:16,420
Come on, Pod.

127
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,921
Let's you and me
go have a drink

128
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:19,462
while the fancy folks
talk, eh?

129
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,504
I left this shit city

130
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:53,338
because I didn't
want to die in it.

131
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:55,629
Am I going to die
in this shit city?

132
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:57,796
You might.

133
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:01,213
And this is all
your idea.

134
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:04,545
Seems every bad idea
has some Lannister cunt
behind it.

135
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,712
And some Clegane cunt
to help them see it through.

136
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:09,420
Remember me?

137
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,338
Yeah, you do.

138
00:15:11,338 --> 00:15:15,420
You're even fucking
uglier than I am now.

139
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,921
What did they do
to you?

140
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:21,254
Doesn't matter.

141
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,462
That's not how it ends
for you, brother.

142
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:26,712
You know who's
coming for you.

143
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:28,796
You've always known.

144
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:44,338
Where is she?

145
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:46,879
She'll be here soon.

146
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,129
Didn't travel with you?

147
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:50,921
No.

148
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,837
-

149
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:47,921
We've been here
for some time.

150
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:50,213
My apologies.

151
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:01,171
We are all
facing a unique--

152
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:03,213
Theon!

153
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:05,129
I have your sister.

154
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:07,545
If you don't submit
to me here, now...

155
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,338
I'll kill her.

156
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:18,545
I think we ought to begin
with larger concerns.

157
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:20,754
Then why
are you talking?

158
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:22,962
You're the smallest
concern here.

159
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:27,213
Do you remember
when we discussed
dwarf jokes?

160
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:28,962
His wasn't even good.

161
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:30,296
He explained it
at the end.

162
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:31,837
Never explain.
It always ruins it.

163
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:33,338
We don't even
let your kind live

164
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:36,545
in the Iron Islands,
you know?

165
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:38,754
We kill you at birth.

166
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:40,796
An act of mercy
for the parents.

167
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:43,462
Perhaps you ought
to sit down.

168
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:44,921
Why?

169
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:47,129
Sit down or leave.

170
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:11,338
We are a group of people
who do not like one another,

171
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:13,879
as this recent
demonstration has shown.

172
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:17,670
We have suffered
at each other's hands.

173
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,046
We have lost people we love
at each other's hands.

174
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:23,338
If all we wanted
was more of the same,

175
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:25,587
there would be no need
for this gathering.

176
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:28,629
We are entirely capable
of waging war against
each other

177
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:30,338
without meeting
face-to-face.

178
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:32,213
So instead,
we should settle
our differences

179
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,879
and live together in harmony
for the rest of our days?

180
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,296
We all know
that will never happen.

181
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:37,670
Then why are we here?

182
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:43,046
This isn't about
living in harmony.

183
00:19:44,545 --> 00:19:46,338
It's just
about living.

184
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:48,921
The same thing
is coming for all of us.

185
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,962
A general you can't
negotiate with.

186
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:54,712
An army that doesn't
leave corpses behind
on the battlefield.

187
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:58,296
Lord Tyrion tells me
a million people live
in this city.

188
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:01,712
They're about to become
a million more soldiers
in the Army of the Dead.

189
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:04,420
I imagine for most of them
it would be an improvement.

190
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,004
This is serious.

191
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:13,171
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't.

192
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,004
I don't think
it's serious at all.

193
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:16,462
I think it's
another bad joke.

194
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:19,213
If my brother Jaime
has informed me correctly,

195
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:20,837
you're asking me
for a truce.

196
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:23,379
Yes.
That's all.

197
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,462
That's all?

198
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:29,420
Pull back my armies
and stand down

199
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,129
while you go
on your monster hunt.

200
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,712
Or while you solidify
and expand your position.

201
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:38,088
Hard for me
to know which it is
with my armies pulled back

202
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:41,754
until you return
and march on my  capital
with four times the men.

203
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:46,088
Your capital will be safe
until the northern threat
is dealt with.

204
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:48,796
You have my word.

205
00:20:48,796 --> 00:20:50,921
The word of
a would-be usurper.

206
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:52,921
There is no conversation

207
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:56,962
that will erase
the last 50 years.

208
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:59,171
We have something
to show you.

209
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,254
We can destroy them
by burning them.

210
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:30,254
And we can destroy them
with dragonglass.

211
00:23:32,296 --> 00:23:34,088
If we don't win
this fight,

212
00:23:34,088 --> 00:23:38,088
then that is the fate
of every person in the world.

213
00:23:55,754 --> 00:23:57,962
There is only one war
that matters--

214
00:23:57,962 --> 00:24:00,296
the Great War.

215
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,796
And it is here.

216
00:24:07,004 --> 00:24:09,129
I didn't believe it
until I saw them.

217
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,796
I saw them all.

218
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:16,712
How many?

219
00:24:16,712 --> 00:24:18,129
A hundred thousand,
at least.

220
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:36,338
Can they swim?

221
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:38,629
No.

222
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:40,004
Good.

223
00:24:41,754 --> 00:24:44,504
I'm taking the Iron Fleet
back to the Iron Islands.

224
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:46,587
What are you
talking about?

225
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:48,504
I've been
around the world.

226
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:50,879
I've seen everything,
things you couldn't imagine,

227
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:52,338
and this...

228
00:24:54,712 --> 00:24:58,129
this is the only thing
I've ever seen that
terrifies me.

229
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,379
I'm going back
to my island.

230
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:10,046
You should go
back to yours.

231
00:25:10,046 --> 00:25:12,004
When winter's over,

232
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:14,670
we'll be the only ones
left alive.

233
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:26,171
He's right to be afraid.

234
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:29,129
And a coward to run.

235
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:31,379
If those things
come for us,

236
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:33,296
there will be
no kingdoms to rule.

237
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:35,712
Everything we suffered
will have been for nothing.

238
00:25:35,712 --> 00:25:38,504
Everything we lost
will have been for nothing.

239
00:25:40,254 --> 00:25:42,046
The crown accepts
your truce.

240
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:48,420
Until the dead are defeated,
they are the true enemy.

241
00:25:57,254 --> 00:26:00,254
In return,
the King in the North
will extend this truce.

242
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:04,462
He will remain in the North
where he belongs.

243
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,379
He will not take up arms
against the Lannisters.

244
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:08,796
He will not
choose sides.

245
00:26:08,796 --> 00:26:11,088
Just the King
in the North?

246
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:13,545
- Not me?
-

247
00:26:13,545 --> 00:26:16,171
I would never
ask it of you.

248
00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:17,754
You would never
agree to it.

249
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:20,254
And if you did,
I would trust you
even less than I do now.

250
00:26:21,587 --> 00:26:24,504
I ask it only
of Ned Stark's son.

251
00:26:24,504 --> 00:26:28,046
I know Ned Stark's son
will be true to his word.

252
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:45,004
I am true to my word.

253
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:46,754
Or I try to be.

254
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:52,462
That is why
I cannot give you
what you ask.

255
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:56,462
I cannot serve
two queens.

256
00:26:58,837 --> 00:27:00,254
And I have already
pledged myself

257
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:04,004
to Queen Daenerys
of House Targaryen.

258
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:17,712
Then there is
nothing left to discuss.

259
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:20,712
The dead will come north first.
Enjoy dealing with them.

260
00:27:20,712 --> 00:27:22,712
We will deal with
whatever is left of you.

261
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:32,837
Ser Jaime.

262
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:34,296
It's been good
to see you.

263
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:36,296
I imagine the next time
will be across a battlefield.

264
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:37,879
We both saw
what just happened.

265
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:39,629
We both saw
that... thing.

266
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:42,420
Yes, and I'm not
looking forward to
seeing more of them.

267
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,088
But I'm loyal
to the queen,

268
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:46,004
and you're loyal to Sansa
and her dolt brother.

269
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:48,129
Oh, fuck loyalty!

270
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:49,670
Fuck loyalty?

271
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,213
This goes beyond houses
and honor and oaths.

272
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,712
Talk to the queen.

273
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:01,712
And tell her what?

274
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:14,213
I wish you hadn't
done that.

275
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:21,379
I'm grateful
for your loyalty,

276
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:25,462
but my dragon died
so that we could be here.

277
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:27,879
If it's all for nothing,

278
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:30,046
then he died
for nothing.

279
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:31,545
I know!

280
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:34,213
I'm pleased
you bent the knee
to our queen.

281
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,921
I would
have advised it,
had you asked.

282
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:38,879
But have you
ever considered

283
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:41,088
learning how to lie
every now and then?

284
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,088
Just a bit?

285
00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:46,462
I'm not going to swear
an oath I can't uphold.

286
00:28:47,837 --> 00:28:49,420
Talk about my father
if you want,

287
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,504
tell me that's the attitude
that got him killed.

288
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:55,587
But when enough people
make false promises,

289
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:58,754
words stop meaning
anything.

290
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:01,921
Then there
are no more answers,
only better and better lies.

291
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:04,670
And lies won't help us
in this fight.

292
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,754
That is indeed a problem.

293
00:29:06,754 --> 00:29:10,296
The more immediate problem
is that we're fucked.

294
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:12,921
Any ideas
as to how we might

295
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:14,921
change that state
of affairs?

296
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,754
Only one.

297
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:20,171
Everyone stays here,

298
00:29:20,171 --> 00:29:22,962
and I go and talk
to my sister.

299
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:27,379
I didn't come all this way
to have my Hand murdered.

300
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:29,171
I don't want Cersei
to murder me either.

301
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:32,171
I could have stayed in my cell
and saved a great deal
of trouble.

302
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:34,213
I did this.

303
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:36,712
- I should go.
- She'll definitely
murder you.

304
00:29:36,712 --> 00:29:40,088
I go see
my sister alone.

305
00:29:41,587 --> 00:29:43,088
Or we all go home

306
00:29:43,088 --> 00:29:44,837
and we're right back
where we started.

307
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:51,046
- You spoke with her?
- At her until she
kicked me out.

308
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:54,129
She thinks
I was an idiot
to trust you.

309
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:56,254
A lot of people
seem to think that,
actually.

310
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,879
I'm about to step
into a room

311
00:30:57,879 --> 00:30:59,670
with the most murderous
woman in the world

312
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,587
who's already tried
to kill me twice,
that I know of.

313
00:31:03,587 --> 00:31:05,213
Who's an idiot?

314
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:11,088
I suppose we should
say goodbye,

315
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:12,670
one idiot to another.

316
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,504
I shouldn't
be surprised,
I suppose.

317
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:15,296
She's your kind
of woman--

318
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:17,837
a foreign whore
who doesn't know
her place.

319
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:21,629
A foreign whore
you can't abduct,
beat, or intimidate.

320
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:23,338
That must be
difficult for you.

321
00:32:23,338 --> 00:32:25,796
So you bring her here
with her pet Northerner,

322
00:32:25,796 --> 00:32:27,712
- whom you've convinced
to bow down before her.
- I didn't know about that.

323
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,796
And now you've got them both
working towards the same goal,

324
00:32:29,796 --> 00:32:31,921
the goal
you've worked towards
your entire life...

325
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:35,004
- Cersei, I didn't know.
- ...the destruction
of this family.

326
00:32:35,004 --> 00:32:38,338
I am the one
preventing that
from happening.

327
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:40,879
Daenerys didn't want
to debate and negotiate.

328
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:42,338
She didn't want
to bring you words.

329
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:44,296
She wanted to bring you
fire and blood

330
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,420
until I advised her
otherwise.

331
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,213
I don't want
to destroy our family.

332
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:50,171
I never have.

333
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:51,629
You killed our father.

334
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:53,254
After he sentenced me
to death

335
00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:55,837
for a crime
I didn't commit,
yes, I killed him.

336
00:32:55,837 --> 00:32:57,504
Hate me for it
if you want.

337
00:32:57,504 --> 00:32:59,837
I hate myself for it
in spite of what he was,

338
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:02,296
in spite of
what he did to me.

339
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:04,046
Oh, poor little man.

340
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:05,754
Your papa
was mean to you.

341
00:33:05,754 --> 00:33:09,796
Do you have any idea
what you did when you
fired that crossbow?

342
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:11,629
You left us open.

343
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:13,213
You laid us bare
for the vultures,

344
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:16,754
and the vultures came
and tore us apart.

345
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:18,420
You may not
have killed Joffrey,

346
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,338
but you killed Myrcella,
you killed Tommen.

347
00:33:20,338 --> 00:33:22,379
No one would've touched them
if Father was here.

348
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,962
- No one would have dared--
- I have never been more sorry
about anything.

349
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,670
I will not hear it,
not from you.

350
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,420
I will not hear it!

351
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:33,712
All right.

352
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,171
You love your family,

353
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:38,254
and I have
destroyed it.

354
00:33:38,254 --> 00:33:41,004
I will always
be a threat.

355
00:33:41,004 --> 00:33:42,338
So put an end to me.

356
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:53,379
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a mother.

357
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:56,129
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a father.

358
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:57,462
If it weren't for me,

359
00:33:57,462 --> 00:33:59,545
you'd have
two beautiful children.

360
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:01,712
I've thought
about killing you

361
00:34:01,712 --> 00:34:03,379
more times
than I can count.

362
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:07,379
Do it!
Say the word.

363
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:19,296
I am more sorry
about the children
than you could ever know.

364
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:22,462
- I will not--
- I don't care.
I loved them.

365
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:24,338
You know I did.

366
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:27,837
You know it in your heart
if there's anything
left of it.

367
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,670
It doesn't matter.

368
00:35:33,629 --> 00:35:37,254
Your love doesn't matter.
Your feelings don't matter.

369
00:35:37,254 --> 00:35:39,420
I don't care
why you did what you did.

370
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,296
I only care
what it cost us.

371
00:35:42,296 --> 00:35:43,670
It cost us our future.

372
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:47,462
If there's no future,
then why are we here?

373
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:49,462
Why did you
allow me to come?

374
00:35:49,462 --> 00:35:52,504
Not to help my enemies
collaborate in my destruction.

375
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:54,254
Yes, no,
not what you hoped for,

376
00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:56,796
but you must have
hoped for something.

377
00:35:57,837 --> 00:36:00,379
What did you hope for?

378
00:36:00,379 --> 00:36:04,046
- To make Jon Snow
submit to your queen?
- Mm, not like this.

379
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:06,420
But eventually,
you want everyone
to bend the knee to her.

380
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,171
- Yes.
- Why?

381
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:09,754
Because I think

382
00:36:09,754 --> 00:36:11,587
she will make the world
a better place.

383
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,504
You said she'd destroy
King's Landing.

384
00:36:15,712 --> 00:36:17,629
She knows herself.

385
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:19,171
She chose an advisor

386
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:22,504
who would check
her worst impulses
instead of feeding them.

387
00:36:22,504 --> 00:36:24,504
That's the difference
between you.

388
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:26,712
I don't care about
checking my worst impulses.

389
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:29,338
I don't care about
making the world
a better place.

390
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:31,129
Hang the world.

391
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:33,587
That thing
you dragged here,

392
00:36:33,587 --> 00:36:37,046
I know what it is,
I know what it means.

393
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:39,254
And when it came at me,
I didn't think about
the world.

394
00:36:39,254 --> 00:36:41,338
Not at all.

395
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:42,921
As soon as
it opened its mouth,

396
00:36:42,921 --> 00:36:44,296
the world
disappeared for me,

397
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:46,420
right down
its black throat.

398
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,796
All I could think about
was keeping those
gnashing teeth

399
00:36:48,796 --> 00:36:50,338
away from the ones
who matter most,

400
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:52,129
away from my family.

401
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:55,754
Maybe Euron Greyjoy
had the right idea.

402
00:36:55,754 --> 00:36:58,545
Get on a boat,
take those who matter--

403
00:36:58,545 --> 00:36:59,712
You're pregnant.

404
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:34,879
No one is less happy
about this than I am.

405
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,296
I know.

406
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:41,462
I respect
what you did.

407
00:37:41,462 --> 00:37:43,796
Wish you hadn't done it,
but I respect it.

408
00:37:54,462 --> 00:37:57,962
This place was the beginning
of the end for my family.

409
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:06,296
A dragon
is not a slave.

410
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:11,587
They were terrifying.

411
00:38:11,587 --> 00:38:13,296
Extraordinary.

412
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:17,754
They filled people
with wonder and awe,

413
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,004
and we locked them
in here.

414
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:22,837
They wasted away.

415
00:38:24,046 --> 00:38:26,338
They grew small.

416
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,962
And we grew small
as well.

417
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:32,879
We weren't extraordinary
without them.

418
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:34,712
We were just like
everyone else.

419
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:41,670
You're not like
everyone else.

420
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:50,004
And your family
hasn't seen its end.

421
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:52,796
You're still here.

422
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:55,338
I can't
have children.

423
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:56,921
Who told you that?

424
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:59,879
The witch who
murdered my husband.

425
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,088
Has it occurred to you
she might not have been

426
00:39:02,088 --> 00:39:03,879
a reliable source
of information?

427
00:39:09,712 --> 00:39:11,837
You were right
from the beginning.

428
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:15,046
If I had trusted you,
everything would
be different.

429
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:20,545
So, what now?

430
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,046
I can't forget what I saw
north of the Wall.

431
00:39:27,046 --> 00:39:28,962
And I can't pretend
that Cersei

432
00:39:28,962 --> 00:39:32,254
won't take back
half the country
the moment I march north.

433
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:36,879
It appears
Tyrion's assessment
was correct.

434
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:40,379
We're fucked.

435
00:40:33,545 --> 00:40:35,629
My armies will not
stand down.

436
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:39,171
I will not pull them
back to the capital.

437
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:46,462
I will march them north
to fight alongside you
in the Great War.

438
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:50,462
The darkness
is coming for us all.

439
00:40:52,254 --> 00:40:55,213
We'll face it together.

440
00:40:55,213 --> 00:40:58,004
And when
the Great War is over,

441
00:40:58,004 --> 00:41:01,338
perhaps you'll remember
I chose to help

442
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:04,796
with no promises
or assurances from
any of you.

443
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:10,213
I expect not.

444
00:41:12,629 --> 00:41:14,379
Call our banners.

445
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:15,879
All of them.

446
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:22,629
-

447
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:32,129
It's not easy for ravens
to fly in these storms.

448
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:34,129
Perhaps Jon tried
to send word earlier.

449
00:41:34,129 --> 00:41:37,545
No, this is
the way he is,

450
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:39,921
the way
he's always been.

451
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:42,545
He never asked for my opinion.
Why would he start now?

452
00:41:42,545 --> 00:41:46,296
I can't believe he'd
surrender the Northern crown
without consulting you.

453
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,712
This is his writing,
his signature.

454
00:41:48,712 --> 00:41:51,879
He pledged to fight
for Daenerys Targaryen.

455
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:53,962
He's bent the knee.

456
00:41:53,962 --> 00:41:56,545
I've heard gossip

457
00:41:56,545 --> 00:42:00,545
that the Dragon Queen
is quite beautiful.

458
00:42:00,545 --> 00:42:02,754
What does that have to do
with anything?

459
00:42:05,046 --> 00:42:07,796
Jon is young
and unmarried.

460
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:10,004
Daenerys is young
and unmarried.

461
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:12,962
You think he wants
to marry her?

462
00:42:12,962 --> 00:42:16,213
An alliance
makes sense.

463
00:42:16,213 --> 00:42:18,420
Together, they'd be
difficult to defeat.

464
00:42:20,046 --> 00:42:23,046
He was named
King in the North.

465
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:26,879
He can be unnamed.

466
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:33,379
Even if I wanted to,
Arya would never go along.

467
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:36,213
She always loved Jon
far more than she ever
loved me,

468
00:42:36,213 --> 00:42:39,420
and she'd kill anyone
who betrayed her family.

469
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,420
You are family, too.

470
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,004
Would Arya really murder
her own sister?

471
00:42:46,004 --> 00:42:48,338
Do you know
what she is now?

472
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:51,712
Do you know what
the Faceless Men are?

473
00:42:51,712 --> 00:42:53,921
Only by reputation.

474
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:57,088
They worship
the God of Death,
I believe.

475
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:59,712
I never trust
godly men.

476
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:01,213
They're killers.

477
00:43:01,213 --> 00:43:03,088
And Arya
was one of them.

478
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:09,545
What do you think
she's after?

479
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,129
She's your sister.

480
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:14,254
You know her far better
than I ever could.

481
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:22,545
Sometimes
when I try to understand
a person's motives,

482
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:24,462
I play a little game.

483
00:43:26,962 --> 00:43:28,962
I assume the worst.

484
00:43:31,962 --> 00:43:34,796
What's the worst reason
they could possibly have

485
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:39,754
for saying what they say
and doing what they do?

486
00:43:39,754 --> 00:43:41,962
Then I ask myself,

487
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:45,129
"How well does
that reason explain

488
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:48,088
what they say
and what they do?"

489
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:51,462
So, tell me--

490
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,004
what's the worst thing
she could want?

491
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:01,837
She could
want me dead

492
00:44:01,837 --> 00:44:05,046
because she thinks
I wronged my family.

493
00:44:05,046 --> 00:44:07,338
Why did she come
to Winterfell?

494
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:12,504
To kill me

495
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:16,338
for marrying our enemies
and betraying my family.

496
00:44:16,338 --> 00:44:19,338
Why did
she unearth the letter
Cersei made you write?

497
00:44:22,046 --> 00:44:26,129
To provide proof
of my betrayals.

498
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:30,879
To provide justification
after she murders me.

499
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:34,545
And after
she murders you,

500
00:44:34,545 --> 00:44:37,213
what does she become?

501
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:44,420
Lady of Winterfell.

502
00:44:59,462 --> 00:45:02,379
If we have the Dothraki
ride hard on the kingsroad,

503
00:45:02,379 --> 00:45:05,046
they'll arrive at Winterfell
within the fortnight.

504
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:06,545
And the Unsullied?

505
00:45:06,545 --> 00:45:08,171
We can sail with them
to White Harbor,

506
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:10,879
meet the Dothraki here
on the kingsroad,

507
00:45:10,879 --> 00:45:13,837
then ride together
to Winterfell.

508
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:17,088
Perhaps you should fly
to Winterfell, Your Grace.

509
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:19,587
You have many enemies
in the North.

510
00:45:19,587 --> 00:45:21,837
Thousands fell
fighting your father.

511
00:45:21,837 --> 00:45:25,545
All it takes
is one angry man
with a crossbow.

512
00:45:25,545 --> 00:45:27,754
He'll see
your silver hair
on the kingsroad

513
00:45:27,754 --> 00:45:30,796
and know that
one well-placed bolt
will make him a hero.

514
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:33,420
The man who killed
the conqueror.

515
00:45:34,962 --> 00:45:36,754
It's your decision,
Your Grace.

516
00:45:36,754 --> 00:45:39,962
But if we're going to be
allies in this war,

517
00:45:39,962 --> 00:45:44,046
it's important
for the Northerners
to see us as allies.

518
00:45:44,046 --> 00:45:47,213
If we sail
to White Harbor together,

519
00:45:47,213 --> 00:45:49,462
I think it sends
a better message.

520
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:58,670
I've not come
to conquer the North.

521
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,004
I'm coming to save
the North.

522
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:07,962
We sail together.

523
00:46:23,129 --> 00:46:24,129
Jon.

524
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:27,629
Can I speak
with you?

525
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:32,088
All right.

526
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,545
What you did
in King's Landing,

527
00:46:40,545 --> 00:46:42,670
what you said...

528
00:46:44,837 --> 00:46:48,254
you could've
lied to Cersei

529
00:46:48,254 --> 00:46:51,171
about bending the knee
to Daenerys.

530
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:57,629
You risked everything
to tell an enemy the truth.

531
00:46:59,545 --> 00:47:02,004
We went down there
to make peace.

532
00:47:02,004 --> 00:47:05,504
And it seems to me
we need to be honest
with each other

533
00:47:05,504 --> 00:47:06,879
if we're going
to fight together.

534
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,879
You've always known
what was right.

535
00:47:14,379 --> 00:47:17,670
Even when we were all
young and stupid,

536
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,171
you always knew.

537
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:21,420
Every step you take...

538
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,754
it's always
the right step.

539
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:25,879
It's not.

540
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:28,129
It may seem that way
from the outside,

541
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:31,545
but I promise you,
it's not true.

542
00:47:33,962 --> 00:47:36,545
I've done
plenty of things
that I regret.

543
00:47:36,545 --> 00:47:38,254
Not compared to me,
you haven't.

544
00:47:38,254 --> 00:47:39,879
No.

545
00:47:41,712 --> 00:47:43,504
Not compared to you.

546
00:47:54,754 --> 00:47:57,379
I always wanted
to do the right thing.

547
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:02,129
Be the right
kind of person.

548
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,712
But I never knew
what that meant.

549
00:48:06,129 --> 00:48:08,462
It always seemed
like there's...

550
00:48:12,545 --> 00:48:14,962
like there was
an impossible choice
I had to make.

551
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,213
Stark or Greyjoy.

552
00:48:22,462 --> 00:48:27,088
Our father was
more of a father to you
than yours ever was.

553
00:48:27,088 --> 00:48:29,921
- He was.
- And you betrayed him.

554
00:48:29,921 --> 00:48:31,796
Betrayed his memory.

555
00:48:31,796 --> 00:48:32,754
I did.

556
00:48:37,796 --> 00:48:39,545
But you never
lost him.

557
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,504
He's a part of you.

558
00:48:47,046 --> 00:48:48,796
Just like
he's a part of me.

559
00:48:48,796 --> 00:48:50,962
But the things
I've done...

560
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,420
It's not my place
to forgive you
for all of it.

561
00:48:58,796 --> 00:49:02,004
But what I can
forgive,

562
00:49:02,004 --> 00:49:03,420
I do.

563
00:49:09,796 --> 00:49:11,962
You don't need
to choose.

564
00:49:13,296 --> 00:49:15,254
You're a Greyjoy...

565
00:49:17,462 --> 00:49:18,796
and you're a Stark.

566
00:49:32,504 --> 00:49:35,420
When I was
Ramsay's prisoner,

567
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:39,462
Yara tried
to save me.

568
00:49:39,462 --> 00:49:43,004
She's the only one

569
00:49:43,004 --> 00:49:44,962
who tried to save me.

570
00:49:52,046 --> 00:49:54,213
She needs me now.

571
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:57,004
So, why are you
still talking to me?

572
00:50:11,254 --> 00:50:12,712
Load up.

573
00:50:12,712 --> 00:50:14,338
Load up, lads.
Go on.

574
00:50:14,338 --> 00:50:16,670
-
- Tide's coming in.

575
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,379
All of us chose
to follow Yara.

576
00:50:37,837 --> 00:50:41,670
We left
the Iron Islands
for Yara.

577
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,504
She would never
leave one of us behind.

578
00:50:47,379 --> 00:50:49,088
We're not
leaving her behind.

579
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,545
Your sister's dead.

580
00:50:50,545 --> 00:50:52,254
- She's not dead.
- She's dead.

581
00:50:52,254 --> 00:50:55,129
Even if Euron hasn't
cut her throat yet,
she's dead.

582
00:50:55,129 --> 00:51:00,254
- She's our queen.
- She's your sister,
and you left her to die.

583
00:51:00,254 --> 00:51:01,754
I did.

584
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:07,004
I ran from my uncle.

585
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:08,420
I was a coward.

586
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,670
So, why in fuck's name
should we listen to you?

587
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:15,296
They say the dead
can't swim.

588
00:51:15,296 --> 00:51:16,879
We're going
to sail east,

589
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:19,254
find a nice,
quiet island,

590
00:51:19,254 --> 00:51:22,254
kill all the men,
and take their wives
for ourselves.

591
00:51:22,254 --> 00:51:24,670
- We're done with all that.
- Who says we are?

592
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,587
Yara did.
She made a pledge.

593
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:32,670
We're going
to find her,

594
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:35,462
and we're going
to set her free.

595
00:51:37,545 --> 00:51:39,670
-

596
00:51:43,921 --> 00:51:47,004
Run away,
little Theon.

597
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:48,962
It's what
you do best.

598
00:51:52,004 --> 00:51:53,796
He needs to shut
his mouth.

599
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:03,504
-Hey!
-

600
00:52:05,545 --> 00:52:09,754
-
- Man #Oh, yes!

601
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:12,504
- Man #
That's more like it.
-

602
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:30,338
Stay down...

603
00:52:31,629 --> 00:52:33,129
or I'll kill you!

604
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:47,171
I said stay down
or I'll kill you!

605
00:54:00,088 --> 00:54:01,754
Not for me.

606
00:54:05,046 --> 00:54:06,504
For Yara!

607
00:54:06,504 --> 00:54:07,921
Yara!

608
00:54:53,504 --> 00:54:55,962
Have my sister brought
to the Great Hall.

609
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,213
Are you sure
you want to do this?

610
00:55:46,046 --> 00:55:49,296
It's not what I want.
It's what honor demands.

611
00:55:49,296 --> 00:55:52,213
And what does
honor demand?

612
00:55:52,213 --> 00:55:55,088
That I defend my family
from those who would harm us.

613
00:55:55,088 --> 00:55:58,712
That I defend the North
from those who would
betray us.

614
00:56:00,962 --> 00:56:02,670
All right, then.

615
00:56:04,088 --> 00:56:05,379
Get on with it.

616
00:56:08,213 --> 00:56:10,379
You stand accused
of murder.

617
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:13,213
You stand accused
of treason.

618
00:56:13,213 --> 00:56:16,004
How do you answer
these charges...

619
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,254
Lord Baelish?

620
00:56:36,004 --> 00:56:37,545
My sister asked you
a question.

621
00:56:42,254 --> 00:56:43,754
Lady Sansa,
forgive me...

622
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,213
I'm a bit confused.

623
00:56:47,213 --> 00:56:49,504
Which charges
confuse you?

624
00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:51,545
Let's start with
the simplest one--

625
00:56:51,545 --> 00:56:54,129
you murdered our aunt,
Lysa Arryn.

626
00:56:54,129 --> 00:56:57,004
You pushed her
through the Moon Door
and watched her fall.

627
00:56:57,004 --> 00:56:58,879
Do you deny it?

628
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:02,420
I did it
to protect you.

629
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,462
You did it
to take power
in the Vale.

630
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,754
Earlier, you conspired
to murder Jon Arryn.

631
00:57:07,754 --> 00:57:10,254
You gave Lysa Tears of Lys
to poison him.

632
00:57:10,254 --> 00:57:11,296
Do you deny it?

633
00:57:13,629 --> 00:57:16,796
Whatever your aunt
might have told you...

634
00:57:16,796 --> 00:57:19,129
she was
a troubled woman.

635
00:57:20,462 --> 00:57:21,754
She imagined enemies
everywhere.

636
00:57:21,754 --> 00:57:24,129
You had Aunt Lysa send
a letter to our parents

637
00:57:24,129 --> 00:57:26,629
telling them
it was the Lannisters
who murdered Jon Arryn

638
00:57:26,629 --> 00:57:28,129
when, really,
it was you.

639
00:57:28,129 --> 00:57:30,338
The conflict between
the Starks and the Lannisters,

640
00:57:30,338 --> 00:57:31,837
it was you
who started it.

641
00:57:31,837 --> 00:57:32,921
Do you deny it?

642
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:34,545
I know
of no such letter.

643
00:57:34,545 --> 00:57:36,379
You conspired
with Cersei Lannister

644
00:57:36,379 --> 00:57:40,088
and Joffrey Baratheon
to betray our father,
Ned Stark.

645
00:57:40,088 --> 00:57:42,629
Thanks to your treachery,
he was imprisoned

646
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:46,088
and later executed
on false charges
of treason.

647
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,921
- Do you deny it?
- I deny it!

648
00:57:48,921 --> 00:57:52,296
None of you were there
to see what happened.

649
00:57:52,296 --> 00:57:54,254
None of you
knows the truth.

650
00:57:54,254 --> 00:57:56,171
You held a knife
to his throat.

651
00:58:01,379 --> 00:58:04,004
You said,
"I did warn you
not the trust me."

652
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:12,004
You told our mother
this knife belonged
to Tyrion Lannister.

653
00:58:13,338 --> 00:58:15,213
But that was another
one of your lies.

654
00:58:15,213 --> 00:58:17,046
It was yours.

655
00:58:22,171 --> 00:58:25,088
Lady Sansa,
I have known you
since you were a girl.

656
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:27,754
- I've protected you.
- Protected me?

657
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,879
By selling me
to the Boltons?

658
00:58:31,213 --> 00:58:33,545
If we could
speak alone,

659
00:58:33,545 --> 00:58:35,088
I can explain
everything.

660
00:58:37,296 --> 00:58:40,420
Sometimes when
I'm trying to understand
a person's motives,

661
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,004
I play a little game.

662
00:58:43,004 --> 00:58:44,670
I assume the worst.

663
00:58:46,046 --> 00:58:47,962
What's the worst
reason you have

664
00:58:47,962 --> 00:58:49,879
for turning me
against my sister?

665
00:58:51,712 --> 00:58:53,796
That's what you do,
isn't it?

666
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,629
That's what
you've always done--

667
00:58:55,629 --> 00:58:57,462
turn family
against family,

668
00:58:57,462 --> 00:58:59,379
turn sister
against sister.

669
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:01,587
That's what you did
to our mother and Aunt Lysa,

670
00:59:01,587 --> 00:59:03,796
and that's what
you tried to do to us.

671
00:59:03,796 --> 00:59:05,129
Sansa, please.

672
00:59:05,129 --> 00:59:08,962
I'm a slow learner,
it's true.

673
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,420
But I learn.

674
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,670
Give me a chance
to defend myself.

675
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:13,962
I deserve that.

676
00:59:19,796 --> 00:59:21,379
I am Lord Protector
of the Vale

677
00:59:21,379 --> 00:59:23,754
and I command you
to escort me safely
back to the Eyrie.

678
00:59:23,754 --> 00:59:25,046
I think not.

679
00:59:28,338 --> 00:59:31,046
Sansa, I beg you!

680
00:59:32,545 --> 00:59:34,587
I loved your mother
since the time
I was a boy.

681
00:59:34,587 --> 00:59:36,379
And yet,
you betrayed her.

682
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,587
I loved you.

683
00:59:41,587 --> 00:59:43,213
More than anyone.

684
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:46,129
And yet,
you betrayed me.

685
00:59:48,754 --> 00:59:50,504
When you brought me
back to Winterfell,

686
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,046
you told me
there's no justice
in the world,

687
00:59:53,046 --> 00:59:55,254
not unless
we make it.

688
00:59:57,254 --> 01:00:01,670
Thank you for all
your many lessons,
Lord Baelish.

689
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:03,962
I will never
forget them.

690
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,587
Sansa!

691
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:16,796
I...

692
01:00:39,879 --> 01:00:41,338
Our men in King's Landing

693
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:43,004
will march north
in three days' time.

694
01:00:43,004 --> 01:00:44,379
It'll take us
a fortnight

695
01:00:44,379 --> 01:00:45,712
just to gather supplies
for the train.

696
01:00:45,712 --> 01:00:47,254
We don't have
a fortnight.

697
01:00:47,254 --> 01:00:49,254
If the North falls, we fall.
Three days.

698
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:50,796
The remaining forces
in the Westerlands

699
01:00:50,796 --> 01:00:52,504
will take
the river road east.

700
01:00:52,504 --> 01:00:54,046
We'll meet at
Lord Harroway's Town

701
01:00:54,046 --> 01:00:56,046
and march together
to Winterfell.

702
01:00:56,046 --> 01:00:57,213
Ser Jaime.

703
01:00:58,338 --> 01:00:59,712
Your Grace.

704
01:00:59,712 --> 01:01:02,171
My lords,
I need a moment
with my brother.

705
01:01:03,796 --> 01:01:05,629
Your Grace.

706
01:01:08,837 --> 01:01:12,670
- What are you doing?
- Preparing the expedition
north.

707
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,254
Expedition north?

708
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:18,545
I always knew you were
the stupidest Lannister.

709
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:21,213
The Starks and Targaryens
have united against us,

710
01:01:21,213 --> 01:01:23,338
and you want to fight
alongside them?

711
01:01:23,338 --> 01:01:25,296
Are you a traitor
or an idiot?

712
01:01:25,296 --> 01:01:27,254
You pledged our forces
to fight our common enemy--

713
01:01:27,254 --> 01:01:28,712
I'll say whatever
I need to say

714
01:01:28,712 --> 01:01:30,420
to ensure the survival
of our house.

715
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,171
You expect me
to trust the man
who murdered our father?

716
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:36,754
You expect me
to command our troops
to fight beside foreign scum,

717
01:01:36,754 --> 01:01:38,254
to fight for
the Dragon Queen?

718
01:01:38,254 --> 01:01:40,171
You saw it
with your own eyes.

719
01:01:40,171 --> 01:01:42,545
You saw a dead man
trying to kill us.

720
01:01:42,545 --> 01:01:44,379
I saw it burn.

721
01:01:44,379 --> 01:01:46,213
If dragons
can't stop them,

722
01:01:46,213 --> 01:01:49,254
if Dothraki and Unsullied
and Northmen can't stop them,

723
01:01:49,254 --> 01:01:51,254
how will our armies
make a difference?

724
01:01:51,254 --> 01:01:53,254
This isn't about
noble houses,

725
01:01:53,254 --> 01:01:55,379
this is about
the living and the dead!

726
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:57,420
And I intend to stay
amongst the living.

727
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,629
Let the Stark boy
and his new queen
defend the North.

728
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:02,837
We stay here
where we've always been.

729
01:02:02,837 --> 01:02:05,379
I made a promise.

730
01:02:07,545 --> 01:02:10,962
Our child
will rule Westeros.

731
01:02:10,962 --> 01:02:15,837
Our child will never be born
if the dead come south.

732
01:02:15,837 --> 01:02:17,420
The monsters are real.

733
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,545
The white walkers,

734
01:02:19,545 --> 01:02:21,796
the dragons,
the Dothraki screamers--

735
01:02:21,796 --> 01:02:25,796
all the frightening stories
we heard when we were young,
they're all real.

736
01:02:25,796 --> 01:02:27,504
So be it.

737
01:02:27,504 --> 01:02:29,629
Let the monsters
kill each other.

738
01:02:29,629 --> 01:02:31,879
And while they battle
in the North,

739
01:02:31,879 --> 01:02:34,296
we take back the lands
that belong to us.

740
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:37,088
- And then what?
- And then we rule.

741
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:40,004
When the fighting
in the North is over,
someone wins.

742
01:02:40,004 --> 01:02:42,171
You understand that,
don't you?

743
01:02:42,171 --> 01:02:45,670
If the dead win,
they march south
and kill us all.

744
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:48,754
If the living win,
and we've betrayed them,

745
01:02:48,754 --> 01:02:50,712
they march south
and kill us all!

746
01:02:50,712 --> 01:02:53,712
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all.

747
01:02:53,712 --> 01:02:55,129
Most of them
will die in the North.

748
01:02:55,129 --> 01:02:56,712
I faced them
in the field.

749
01:02:56,712 --> 01:02:59,254
We can't beat them.
We can't beat their dragons.

750
01:02:59,254 --> 01:03:00,796
How many dragons
did you see at the pit?

751
01:03:00,796 --> 01:03:02,796
- Two.
- What happened
to the third?

752
01:03:02,796 --> 01:03:05,296
For all we know,
it's guarding her fleet!

753
01:03:05,296 --> 01:03:08,629
She came here
with her dragons and her
Dothraki and her Unsullied.

754
01:03:08,629 --> 01:03:11,420
She came here to show us
all her power.

755
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,462
No, something happened.
The dragons are vulnerable.

756
01:03:14,462 --> 01:03:17,004
We can't beat the Dothraki.
We don't have the numbers.

757
01:03:17,004 --> 01:03:18,837
We don't have the support
of the other houses!

758
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:21,504
No, we have something better.
We have the Iron Bank.

759
01:03:23,504 --> 01:03:27,462
You should've listened more
when Father spoke about
the importance of gold.

760
01:03:27,462 --> 01:03:29,629
Oh, I know
it's boring for you.

761
01:03:29,629 --> 01:03:33,254
You just wanted to hunt
and ride and fight.

762
01:03:33,254 --> 01:03:35,837
But I listened,
I learned.

763
01:03:35,837 --> 01:03:39,837
Highgarden bought us
the most powerful army
in Essos--

764
01:03:39,837 --> 01:03:41,629
the Golden Company.

765
01:03:41,629 --> 01:03:45,338
20,000 men, horses,
elephants, I believe.

766
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:47,004
The Golden Company
is not here.

767
01:03:47,004 --> 01:03:48,379
They're in Essos.

768
01:03:48,379 --> 01:03:52,338
How is a mercenary company
in Essos going to help us?

769
01:03:52,338 --> 01:03:54,837
Do you really think
Euron Greyjoy turned tail

770
01:03:54,837 --> 01:03:56,462
and sailed back
to the Iron Islands?

771
01:03:57,587 --> 01:03:58,962
Do you think
he abandoned

772
01:03:58,962 --> 01:04:02,213
the chance to marry
the queen?

773
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,545
No one walks away
from me.

774
01:04:06,379 --> 01:04:08,046
He's sailing with
his fleet to Essos.

775
01:04:08,046 --> 01:04:10,129
He's going to ferry
the Golden Company back here

776
01:04:10,129 --> 01:04:11,670
to help us win
the war for Westeros.

777
01:04:14,213 --> 01:04:17,379
You plotted
with Euron Greyjoy
without telling me,

778
01:04:17,379 --> 01:04:19,213
the commander
of your armies?

779
01:04:19,213 --> 01:04:21,837
And you conspired
with Tyrion,

780
01:04:21,837 --> 01:04:23,213
the man who murdered
our father,

781
01:04:23,213 --> 01:04:24,545
without telling me,
your queen.

782
01:04:24,545 --> 01:04:26,004
I didn't conspire
with him.

783
01:04:26,004 --> 01:04:27,879
You met with him in secret
without my consent.

784
01:04:27,879 --> 01:04:29,879
You planned to promote
my enemies' interests.

785
01:04:29,879 --> 01:04:32,171
That  is the definition
of conspiracy.

786
01:04:32,171 --> 01:04:34,545
I pledged
to ride north.

787
01:04:34,545 --> 01:04:36,379
I intend to honor
that pledge.

788
01:04:36,379 --> 01:04:38,587
- And that
will be treason.
- Treason?

789
01:04:38,587 --> 01:04:40,837
Disobeying
your queen's command,
fighting with her enemies.

790
01:04:40,837 --> 01:04:42,171
What would you
call it?

791
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,046
Doesn't matter
what I'd call it.

792
01:04:53,004 --> 01:04:55,754
I told you no one
walks away from me.

793
01:04:58,088 --> 01:05:00,629
Are you going to
order him to kill me?

794
01:05:02,754 --> 01:05:04,712
I'm the only one
you have left.

795
01:05:04,712 --> 01:05:07,171
Our children are gone,
our father is gone.

796
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:08,921
It's just
me and you now.

797
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:10,921
There's one more
yet to come.

798
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:15,921
Give the order, then.

799
01:05:35,296 --> 01:05:37,004
I don't
believe you.

800
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:27,420
-
- Come in.

801
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:32,879
Samwell Tarly.

802
01:07:32,879 --> 01:07:35,088
I wasn't sure
if you'd remember me.

803
01:07:35,088 --> 01:07:36,921
I remember everything.

804
01:07:45,088 --> 01:07:47,254
You helped us
get beyond the Wall.

805
01:07:47,254 --> 01:07:49,796
- You're a good man.
- Oh, well, thank you,

806
01:07:49,796 --> 01:07:52,420
but, um, I'm not sure
that I am.

807
01:07:56,587 --> 01:07:58,754
What happened to you
beyond the Wall?

808
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:01,754
I became
the Three-Eyed Raven.

809
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,462
Oh!

810
01:08:07,754 --> 01:08:10,129
I don't know
what that means.

811
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:12,879
I can see things
that happened in the past.

812
01:08:12,879 --> 01:08:16,962
I can see things
happening now

813
01:08:16,962 --> 01:08:18,462
all over the world.

814
01:08:19,879 --> 01:08:22,296
Why did you come
to Winterfell?

815
01:08:23,587 --> 01:08:24,962
Um...

816
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,338
Jon's the one to lead
the fight against the dead.

817
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,420
I know he is.

818
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,379
But he can't
do it alone,

819
01:08:33,379 --> 01:08:36,254
so I've come here
to help him.

820
01:08:36,254 --> 01:08:39,129
He's on his way
back to Winterfell

821
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:40,754
with Daenerys Targaryen.

822
01:08:41,921 --> 01:08:44,962
You--
you saw this in--

823
01:08:44,962 --> 01:08:46,629
in a vision?

824
01:08:49,629 --> 01:08:50,837
Oh.

825
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,837
He needs to know
the truth.

826
01:08:57,088 --> 01:08:58,379
The truth
about what?

827
01:08:58,379 --> 01:09:00,171
About himself.

828
01:09:00,171 --> 01:09:03,712
No one knows.
No one but me.

829
01:09:03,712 --> 01:09:06,670
Jon isn't really
my father's son.

830
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:10,837
He's the son
of Rhaegar Targaryen
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

831
01:09:10,837 --> 01:09:14,670
He was born
in a tower in Dorne.

832
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:17,129
His last name
isn't really Snow,

833
01:09:17,129 --> 01:09:18,004
it's Sand.

834
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:21,379
It's not.

835
01:09:23,088 --> 01:09:25,504
Dornish bastards
are named Sand.

836
01:09:25,504 --> 01:09:29,129
At the Citadel, I transcribed
a High Septon's diary.

837
01:09:29,129 --> 01:09:31,879
He annulled Rhaegar's
marriage to Elia.

838
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,587
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
in a secret ceremony.

839
01:09:37,879 --> 01:09:39,338
Are you certain?

840
01:09:39,338 --> 01:09:42,046
It's what the High Septon
wrote in his private diary.

841
01:09:42,046 --> 01:09:43,879
I don't know
why he'd lie.

842
01:09:45,712 --> 01:09:48,254
Is this something
you can see?

843
01:09:49,712 --> 01:09:53,545
Father, Smith, Warrior,

844
01:09:53,545 --> 01:09:58,420
Mother, Maiden,
Crone, Stranger.

845
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:02,213
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

846
01:10:02,213 --> 01:10:06,545
from this day
until the end of my days.

847
01:10:06,545 --> 01:10:09,670
Bran'
Robert's Rebellion
was built on a lie.

848
01:10:11,796 --> 01:10:14,921
Rhaegar didn't
kidnap my aunt or rape her.

849
01:10:24,504 --> 01:10:26,046
He loved her.

850
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,420
And she loved him.

851
01:11:01,837 --> 01:11:04,796
- Bran'And Jon...
-

852
01:11:06,837 --> 01:11:08,629
Jon's real name...

853
01:11:10,629 --> 01:11:14,962
His name
is Aegon Targaryen.

854
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:17,171
You have
to protect him.

855
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:20,587
Promise me, Ned.

856
01:11:43,379 --> 01:11:45,670
Bran'
He's never been a bastard.

857
01:11:49,587 --> 01:11:52,296
Bran'
He's the heir to
the Iron Throne.

858
01:12:07,129 --> 01:12:08,837
Bran'
He needs to know.

859
01:12:12,046 --> 01:12:13,837
We need to tell him.

860
01:12:24,171 --> 01:12:26,879
Are you
all right?

861
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,796
It's just strange.

862
01:12:28,796 --> 01:12:32,754
In his own horrible way,
I believe he loved me.

863
01:12:36,712 --> 01:12:38,254
You did
the right thing.

864
01:12:38,254 --> 01:12:40,796
You  did it.

865
01:12:40,796 --> 01:12:42,629
I'm just
the executioner.

866
01:12:42,629 --> 01:12:44,379
You passed
the sentence.

867
01:12:46,545 --> 01:12:49,379
You're the Lady
of Winterfell.

868
01:12:49,379 --> 01:12:50,754
Does that bother you?

869
01:12:53,338 --> 01:12:56,213
I was never going to be
as good a lady as you.

870
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:59,171
So I had to be
something else.

871
01:13:01,379 --> 01:13:04,129
I never could have survived
what you survived.

872
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:06,462
You would have.

873
01:13:06,462 --> 01:13:08,462
You're the strongest
person I know.

874
01:13:12,545 --> 01:13:15,088
I believe
that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

875
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:20,462
Well, don't get
used to it.

876
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:22,712
You're still
very strange
and annoying.

877
01:13:29,213 --> 01:13:31,213
"In winter, we must
protect ourselves.

878
01:13:32,754 --> 01:13:34,796
Look after
one another."

879
01:13:36,921 --> 01:13:38,629
Father.

880
01:13:41,754 --> 01:13:45,921
"When the snows fall
and the white winds blow,

881
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,879
the lone wolf dies,

882
01:13:47,879 --> 01:13:50,338
but the pack survives."

883
01:13:57,338 --> 01:13:58,629
I miss him.

884
01:14:01,962 --> 01:14:03,462
Me, too.

885
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:27,213
It's a long way down.

886
01:15:27,213 --> 01:15:31,046
Yeah.
The crows keep telling me
I'll get used to it.

887
01:15:39,796 --> 01:15:42,837
I can see movement...

888
01:15:42,837 --> 01:15:45,545
Watch, on the tree line!

889
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:48,379
Man #
What is it?

890
01:17:19,545 --> 01:17:20,670
Come on!

891
01:17:21,879 --> 01:17:24,504
- Run! Run!
-
