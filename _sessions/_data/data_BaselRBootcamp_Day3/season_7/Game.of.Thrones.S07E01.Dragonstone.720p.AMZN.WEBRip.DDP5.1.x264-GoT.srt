1
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:24,493
The war is over.
Winter has come.

2
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:26,201
The war is not over.

3
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:28,492
The true enemy won't
wait out the storm.

4
00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:33,492
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

5
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:41,577
Our uncle Euron returned
home after a long absence.

6
00:00:44,952 --> 00:00:47,576
He murdered our father,
and took the Salt Throne from Yara.

7
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:49,177
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

8
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:53,202
Build me a thousand ships,
and I will give you this world.

9
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:56,534
There's a storm coming.

10
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:58,077
You'll be wanting
a roof tonight.

11
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:01,367
I don't have much, but I have
hidden a bit of silver

12
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:03,493
from the bandits.

13
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:05,035
What did you do?!

14
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:06,493
They'll both be dead
come winter.

15
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:09,534
Cold winds
are rising in the North.

16
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:11,201
We need good men to help us.

17
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:14,409
You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.

18
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,036
It's not too late for you.

19
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,743
Send me to Oldtown.

20
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,452
I'm to be the new maester.

21
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:24,118
The Citadel has the world's
greatest library.

22
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,576
I'll learn about things
that all help when...

23
00:01:28,077 --> 00:01:29,367
...when they come.

24
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,577
Let go of me!

25
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:44,827
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

26
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:49,161
I'm the three-eyed raven.
I have to be ready for this.

27
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:54,036
Do you know who had this table
carved and painted, Ser Davos?

28
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:55,244
Aegon Targaryen.

29
00:01:55,952 --> 00:01:58,826
Aegon used to live here, and the
Targaryens built this castle.

30
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,107
Aye. So they did.

31
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:03,577
I want us both to go home.
But they took it from us.

32
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:05,244
How do we go home?

33
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:07,709
You're in the great game now,

34
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,577
and the great game's
terrifying. Are you afraid?

35
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:16,826
My name is Arya Stark.
I want you to know that.

36
00:02:57,618 --> 00:03:01,409
You're wondering why
I brought you all here.

37
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,868
After all, we just had a feast.

38
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:07,826
Since when does old Walder

39
00:03:07,827 --> 00:03:10,826
give us two feasts
in a single fortnight?

40
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,285
Well, it's no good being
Lord of the Riverlands

41
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:18,659
if you can't celebrate
with your family.

42
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,160
That's what I say!

43
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:23,576
Yes!

44
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:31,326
I've gathered every Frey
who means a damn thing

45
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:36,659
so I can tell you my plans
for this great house

46
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,534
now that winter has come.

47
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:42,702
But first, a toast!

48
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:47,951
No more of that
Dornish horse piss!

49
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:50,909
This is the finest Arbor gold!

50
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,909
Proper wine for proper heroes!

51
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:01,285
Stand together!

52
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:03,535
Stand together!

53
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,701
Not you.

54
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:16,618
I'm not wasting good wine
on a damn woman.

55
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:24,659
Maybe I'm not
the most pleasant man.

56
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,076
I'll admit it.
But I'm proud of you lot.

57
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:31,201
You're my family,
the men who helped me

58
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:34,243
slaughter the Starks
at the Red Wedding.

59
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:38,367
Yes, yes.

60
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:41,035
Cheer.

61
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:44,367
Brave men, all of you.

62
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,951
Butchered a woman
pregnant with her babe.

63
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:53,784
Cut the throat
of a mother of five.

64
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:56,909
Slaughtered your guests
after inviting them

65
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,660
into your home.

66
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:05,951
But you didn't slaughter
every one of the Starks.

67
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:10,701
No, no, that was your mistake.

68
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:14,576
You should have ripped them
all out, root and stem.

69
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,451
Leave one wolf alive

70
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:26,119
and the sheep are never safe.

71
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:54,036
When people ask you
what happened here...

72
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,327
tell them the North remembers.

73
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,660
Tell them winter came
for House Frey.

74
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:26,868
You wildlings?

75
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:29,785
I'm Meera Reed,
daughter of Howland Reed.

76
00:10:31,827 --> 00:10:33,285
This is Brandon Stark,

77
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:35,493
son of Ned Stark.

78
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:41,327
How do I know that's true?

79
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:47,826
You were at
the Fist of the First Men.

80
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,286
You were at Hardhome.

81
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,161
You've seen
the Army of the Dead.

82
00:10:55,036 --> 00:10:56,410
You've seen the Night King.

83
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:59,493
He's coming for us.

84
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,827
For all of us.

85
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:11,576
Okay, come on.

86
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:13,660
Let's get them inside.

87
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,951
I want every northern
maester to scour their records

88
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:49,118
for any mention of dragonglass.

89
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,201
Dragonglass kills white walkers.

90
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:53,868
It's more valuable
to us now than gold.

91
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:55,534
We need to find it,
we need to mine it,

92
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:57,244
we need to make weapons from it.

93
00:11:58,577 --> 00:12:01,576
Everyone aged 10 to 60

94
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:04,826
will drill daily with spears,
pikes, bow and arrow.

95
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:08,035
It's about time we taught these
boys of summer how to fight.

96
00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:10,326
Not just the boys.

97
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:12,826
We can't defend the North

98
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:14,993
if only half the
population is fighting.

99
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:19,701
You expect me to put a spear
in my granddaughter's hand?

100
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:23,367
I don't plan on knitting by the
fire while men fight for me.

101
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,451
I might be small, Lord Glover,
and I might be a girl,

102
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:28,909
but I am every bit as much
a Northerner as you.

103
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,784
Indeed you are, my lady.
No one has questioned...

104
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:32,910
And I don't need your
permission to defend the North.

105
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:40,659
We'll begin training every man,
woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.

106
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,743
Aye!

107
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:44,243
While we're
preparing for attack,

108
00:12:44,244 --> 00:12:46,576
we need to shore up
our defenses.

109
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:50,076
The only thing standing between us and
the Army of the Dead is the Wall,

110
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:53,993
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

111
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:56,410
I'm not the king
of the Free Folk.

112
00:12:57,952 --> 00:13:00,285
But if we're going to survive
this winter together...

113
00:13:01,827 --> 00:13:04,492
You want us to man
the castles for you?

114
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,076
Aye.

115
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,909
Last time we saw the Night
King was at Hardhome.

116
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,243
The closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

117
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:13,784
Then that's where I'll go.

118
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:16,951
Looks like we're
the Night's Watch now.

119
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:20,826
If they breach the Wall,

120
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:22,367
the first two castles
in their path

121
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,909
are Last Hearth and Karhold.

122
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,576
The Umbers and the Karstarks
betrayed the North.

123
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,201
Their castles
should be torn down

124
00:13:30,202 --> 00:13:31,951
with not a stone left standing.

125
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:34,534
The castles committed no crimes.

126
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:37,951
And we need every fortress
we have for the war to come.

127
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:41,285
We should give the Last Hearth
and Karhold to new families,

128
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:43,826
loyal families who supported
us against Ramsay.

129
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:47,035
Aye!

130
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:49,326
The Umbers and the Karstarks

131
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,826
have fought beside
the Starks for centuries.

132
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:55,993
- They've kept faith for generation after generation.
- And then they broke faith.

133
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:59,076
I'm not going to strip these
families of their ancestral homes

134
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:01,659
because of the crimes
of a few reckless sons.

135
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,326
So there's no
punishment for treason

136
00:14:03,327 --> 00:14:05,827
and no reward for loyalty?

137
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:13,659
The punishment
for treason is death.

138
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,492
Smalljon Umber died
on the field of battle.

139
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:19,326
Harald Karstark died
on the field of battle.

140
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:21,743
They died fighting for Ramsay.

141
00:14:21,744 --> 00:14:23,326
Give the castles to the families

142
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:25,701
of the men who died
fighting for you.

143
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,827
When I was Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch...

144
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:45,659
I executed men who betrayed me.

145
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,909
I executed men who
refused to follow orders.

146
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,701
My father always said,

147
00:14:51,702 --> 00:14:54,285
"The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword,"

148
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:57,576
and I have tried
to live by those words.

149
00:14:57,577 --> 00:15:01,035
But I will not punish a son
for his father's sins,

150
00:15:01,036 --> 00:15:03,492
and I will not take
a family home away

151
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:06,868
from a family it has
belonged to for centuries.

152
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:09,451
That is my decision,

153
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:12,036
and my decision is final.

154
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:19,244
Ned Umber.

155
00:15:27,244 --> 00:15:28,577
Alys Karstark.

156
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:45,409
For centuries,
our families fought

157
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,243
side by side on the battlefield.

158
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:53,243
I ask you to pledge your loyalty
once again to House Stark,

159
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,784
to serve as our bannermen

160
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:58,493
and come to our aid
whenever called upon.

161
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:08,410
Stand.

162
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:14,909
Yesterday's wars
don't matter anymore.

163
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,909
The North needs
to band together,

164
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,286
all the living north.

165
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:22,951
Will you stand beside me,
Ned and Alys,

166
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:25,201
now and always?

167
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:27,659
Now and always!

168
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:49,035
You are my sister,
but I am king now.

169
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:50,659
Will you start wearing a crown?

170
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,285
When you question my decisions

171
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:54,451
in front of the other lords
and ladies, you undermine me.

172
00:16:54,452 --> 00:16:57,160
- So I can't question your decisions anymore?
- Of course you can, but...

173
00:16:57,161 --> 00:16:59,492
Joffrey never let anyone
question his authority.

174
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:01,493
You think he was a good king?

175
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:05,119
Do you think I'm Joffrey?

176
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:11,659
You're as far from Joffrey
as anyone I've ever met.

177
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,161
Thank you.

178
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,868
You're good at this, you know.

179
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,326
- At what?
- At ruling.

180
00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:21,160
No.

181
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:22,161
You are.

182
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:24,660
You are.

183
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:28,451
They respect you,
they really do,

184
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:30,617
but you have to...

185
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:32,035
Why are you laughing?

186
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:34,201
What did father used to say?

187
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:37,534
Everything before the
word "but" is horse shit.

188
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,035
He never said that to me.

189
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:41,743
No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

190
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:44,826
Because he was
trying to protect us.

191
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:47,826
He never wanted us to see
how dirty the world really is,

192
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:50,534
but Father couldn't protect
me and neither can you.

193
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:53,243
- Stop trying.
- All right, I'll stop trying to protect you

194
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:54,617
and you stop trying
to undermine me.

195
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:56,827
I'm not trying to undermine you!

196
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,409
You have to be
smarter than Father.

197
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,076
You need to be
smarter than Robb.

198
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:07,201
I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

199
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,243
and they both
lost their heads for it.

200
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:11,451
And how should I be smarter?

201
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:12,910
By listening to you?

202
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:18,243
Would that be so terrible?

203
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:21,202
A raven from King's
Landing, Your Grace.

204
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:33,243
"Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

205
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:35,160
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

206
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:36,784
Protector of
the Seven Kingdoms..."

207
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:38,244
What does she want?

208
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,285
Come to King's Landing.

209
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:46,118
Bend the knee or suffer
the fate of all traitors.

210
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,243
You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

211
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:50,076
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

212
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:53,118
I'm consumed with the Night
King because I've seen him.

213
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,743
And believe me, you'd think
of little else if you had, too.

214
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:57,451
We still have a wall between
us and the Night King.

215
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:59,285
There's nothing
between us and Cersei.

216
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:02,201
There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

217
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:04,993
Winter is here. The Lannisters
are a southern army.

218
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,451
They've never ranged
this far north.

219
00:19:06,452 --> 00:19:09,784
You're the military man,
but I know her.

220
00:19:09,785 --> 00:19:13,118
If you're her enemy, she'll never
stop until she's destroyed you.

221
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,286
Everyone who's ever crossed her,
she's found a way to murder.

222
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,452
You almost sound
as if you admire her.

223
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:27,286
I learned a great deal from her.

224
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,993
What is this?

225
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:08,659
It's what we've been
waiting for our whole lives.

226
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,451
It's what Father trained us for,
whether he knew it or not.

227
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:12,951
He knew it.

228
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:14,909
Made me memorize
every damn city, town,

229
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,492
lake, forest, and mountain.

230
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:18,660
It's ours now.
We just have to take it.

231
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,534
You've been quiet
since you came home.

232
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:23,993
Are you angry with me?

233
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:26,244
No, not angry.

234
00:20:27,368 --> 00:20:28,368
Are you afraid of me?

235
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:31,493
Should I be?

236
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:39,201
Daenerys Targaryen has chosen
Tyrion to be her Hand.

237
00:20:39,202 --> 00:20:41,993
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

238
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:44,993
hoping to take back
her father's throne.

239
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,409
Our little brother,

240
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,576
the one you love so much,

241
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:51,409
the one you set free,

242
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,701
the one who murdered our
father and our first-born son,

243
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:58,036
now he stands beside our enemies
and gives them counsel.

244
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:05,743
He's out there somewhere
at the head of an armada.

245
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,452
Where will they land?

246
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:11,576
Dragonstone.

247
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:14,367
They have deep-water
ports for the ships.

248
00:21:14,368 --> 00:21:16,367
Stannis left
the castle unoccupied,

249
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:17,826
and that's where she was born.

250
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:20,118
Enemies to the east.

251
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,909
Enemies to the south...

252
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,909
Ellaria Sand
and her brood of bitches.

253
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,743
Enemies to the west...

254
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,576
Olenna, the old cunt.

255
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:31,784
Another traitor.

256
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:33,951
Enemies to the north.

257
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:37,076
Ned Stark's bastard has been
named King in the North

258
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:40,076
and that murdering whore
Sansa stands beside him.

259
00:21:40,077 --> 00:21:42,743
Enemies everywhere.
We're surrounded by traitors.

260
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:44,451
You're in command
of the Lannister army now.

261
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:47,576
- How do we proceed?
- Winter is here.

262
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:50,868
We can't win a war if we can't
feed our men and our horses.

263
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:55,035
The Tyrells have the grain,
the Tyrells have the livestock.

264
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:57,076
Will the Tyrell bannermen
stand alongside

265
00:21:57,077 --> 00:22:00,367
a Dothraki horde
and Unsullied slave soldiers?

266
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:03,035
If they think Daenerys will win.

267
00:22:03,036 --> 00:22:04,993
No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

268
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:08,119
Right now, we look
like the losing side.

269
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,243
I'm the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

270
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:13,993
Three kingdoms, at best.

271
00:22:13,994 --> 00:22:16,534
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

272
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,326
I understand we're
in a war for survival.

273
00:22:18,327 --> 00:22:21,367
I understand whoever loses dies.

274
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:23,659
I understand whoever wins
could launch a dynasty

275
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,243
that lasts a thousand years.

276
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,826
A dynasty for whom?

277
00:22:27,827 --> 00:22:30,826
Our children are dead.

278
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:32,285
We're the last of us.

279
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:34,327
A dynasty for us, then.

280
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:39,036
We never talked about Tommen.

281
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:43,993
There's nothing to say.

282
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:45,951
Our baby boy killed himself.

283
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:47,492
He betrayed me.

284
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:48,993
He betrayed us both.

285
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,826
Should we spend our days
mourning the dead...

286
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,243
Mother, father,
and all our children?

287
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:54,826
- Cersei...
- I loved them. I did.

288
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:58,035
But they're ashes now and
we're still flesh and blood.

289
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:01,036
We're the last Lannisters,
the last ones who count.

290
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,534
Even Lannisters can't
survive without allies.

291
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:12,701
Where are our allies now?

292
00:23:12,702 --> 00:23:14,909
You saw what happened to
Walder Frey and his family.

293
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,576
I heard.

294
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:19,118
- How could we ever trust a man like that?
- We couldn't.

295
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,118
He was a useless, old coward,

296
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,951
but the Freys supported us.

297
00:23:22,952 --> 00:23:24,326
Now they're all dead.

298
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:26,035
Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

299
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:27,576
We need allies.

300
00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:29,367
Stronger, better allies.

301
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:31,493
We can't win this war alone.

302
00:23:33,493 --> 00:23:37,119
You think I listened to Father for
40 years and learned nothing?

303
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,617
The Greyjoys?

304
00:24:15,618 --> 00:24:18,201
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

305
00:24:18,202 --> 00:24:21,035
- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like all of them.

306
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:22,617
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

307
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:25,118
the new King
of the Iron Islands.

308
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,826
You said yourself we needed
stronger, better allies.

309
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:30,951
- There you are.
- How are they better allies?

310
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:33,367
How are they different
from the Freys?

311
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:34,951
They both broke their promises

312
00:24:34,952 --> 00:24:37,243
and murdered their former friends
as soon as it suited them.

313
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:40,243
So does everyone
when it suits them.

314
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:42,868
Unlike the Freys,
they have ships.

315
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:45,492
- And they're good at killing.
- They're not good at anything.

316
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:48,909
I know the ironborn. They're
bitter, angry little people.

317
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,118
All they know how to do is steal things
they can't build or grow themselves.

318
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,243
Euron Greyjoy didn't
come here for that.

319
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:56,285
Oh, what did
he come here for, then?

320
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,952
A queen.

321
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,868
The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

322
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:16,243
they turned on me.

323
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:17,492
Their own uncle.

324
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:20,118
They stole
my best ships and ran.

325
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,285
Sailed them
right across the world

326
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:24,576
and gave them
to the Dragon Queen

327
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:28,035
so she could bring her
armies here to attack you.

328
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:31,492
It's nothing compared
to the treason you suffered

329
00:25:31,493 --> 00:25:35,160
at the hands of a family
member, from what I hear.

330
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:37,869
But still, it bothers me.

331
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:42,534
Murdering them would
make me feel a lot better.

332
00:25:42,535 --> 00:25:46,701
And since it appears that all
our treasonous family members

333
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:48,617
are fighting for the same side,

334
00:25:48,618 --> 00:25:51,160
I thought we rightful monarchs

335
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:53,744
could murder them together.

336
00:25:59,744 --> 00:26:02,535
You're not a rightful
monarch, though, are you?

337
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,659
The Greyjoys rebelled against the
throne for the right to be monarchs,

338
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,701
but as I recall,
you were soundly defeated.

339
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:15,534
Come to mention it,

340
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:17,909
weren't you the one
who started that rebellion

341
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,118
by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

342
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,826
You certainly caught us there.

343
00:26:23,827 --> 00:26:26,659
Very smart move on your part.

344
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,909
Of course, we all made it
to the Iron Islands anyway.

345
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,118
I was there.

346
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,951
I remember very well.

347
00:26:33,952 --> 00:26:35,492
I saw you.

348
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,784
I heard so much talk.

349
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:41,409
The best in the world.
No one can stop him.

350
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,118
I didn't believe it,
to be honest.

351
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,409
But I must say when you
rushed through the breach

352
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,577
and started
cutting people down...

353
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,784
it was glorious.

354
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:55,201
Like a dance.

355
00:26:55,202 --> 00:26:58,409
The people I was cutting
down were your own kin.

356
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,743
The place was getting crowded.

357
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,326
I enjoyed watching it.
I truly did.

358
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:05,534
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

359
00:27:05,535 --> 00:27:07,993
A good thing for me.

360
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:11,617
If you hadn't crushed us, I
wouldn't have gone into exile.

361
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:13,534
If I hadn't done that,

362
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:17,119
I wouldn't be the greatest
captain on the 14 seas.

363
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:19,994
If not the most humble.

364
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:22,286
You're not humble.

365
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:26,244
You're the queen
of a great nation.

366
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:29,201
You don't care about
the Iron Islands.

367
00:27:29,202 --> 00:27:33,868
They're nothing but rocks
and bird shit and...

368
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:36,743
And a lot of very
unattractive people.

369
00:27:36,744 --> 00:27:39,367
The Iron Fleet,
on the other hand,

370
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:42,492
that's something else entirely.

371
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:45,784
It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

372
00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:50,367
With the Iron Fleet,
you own the seas.

373
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:53,201
You can defeat
the invaders of the east

374
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:56,160
and the pretenders
of the north and south.

375
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:57,785
What do you want in return?

376
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:02,909
Ever since I was a little boy,

377
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,826
I wanted to grow up and marry

378
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,951
the most beautiful woman
in the world.

379
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:09,659
So here I am,

380
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,118
with a thousand ships

381
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,660
and two good hands.

382
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:20,660
I decline your proposal.

383
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,201
Why?

384
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,869
You're not trustworthy.

385
00:28:27,286 --> 00:28:29,367
You've broken promises
to allies before

386
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:31,826
and murdered them
at the nearest opportunity.

387
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:33,368
You murdered your own brother.

388
00:28:34,702 --> 00:28:37,035
You should try it.
Feels wonderful.

389
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,701
I don't expect you
to trust me outright.

390
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:43,076
You need proof
of my honest intentions.

391
00:28:43,077 --> 00:28:44,534
In my experience,

392
00:28:44,535 --> 00:28:47,534
the surest way to a woman's
heart is with a gift.

393
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:49,826
A priceless gift.

394
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:51,701
I won't return to King's Landing

395
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:53,744
until I have that for you.

396
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,576
Ah, Maester Weyland.

397
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:06,077
A drinker's
liver if ever I saw one.

398
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:08,327
Weigh that.

399
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:12,784
The triumph
of transitory pleasures.

400
00:32:12,785 --> 00:32:14,701
Mankind's curse.

401
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:17,784
Archmaester, I was wondering...

402
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,743
What's the weight?

403
00:32:19,744 --> 00:32:22,702
Um, 147.

404
00:32:25,618 --> 00:32:28,701
I was wondering if you had
considered my proposition.

405
00:32:28,702 --> 00:32:31,784
I don't remember
your proposition.

406
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:35,076
I asked you if, in light of
what I've seen in the North,

407
00:32:35,077 --> 00:32:38,243
if I could have access to the
restricted area of the library.

408
00:32:38,244 --> 00:32:39,951
That area is reserved
for maesters.

409
00:32:39,952 --> 00:32:42,451
- Are you a maester?
- No.

410
00:32:42,452 --> 00:32:44,577
Not a very strong
proposition, is it?

411
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:56,534
Archmaester, with respect,

412
00:32:56,535 --> 00:32:58,367
I've seen them...

413
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,617
The Army of the Dead.

414
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:02,993
The white walkers.

415
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:05,492
I was sent here to learn
how to defeat them,

416
00:33:05,493 --> 00:33:08,035
but everyone in the Citadel,

417
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:10,201
those who will even talk to me,

418
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:13,035
they all doubt the walkers ever
existed in the first place.

419
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:15,576
Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

420
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,660
It's their job.

421
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:25,493
But the tales of the Long Night
can't be pure fabrication.

422
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:30,243
Too many similarities
from unconnected sources.

423
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:32,826
Sources in the restricted area?

424
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:34,452
The very same.

425
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,201
And the simplest explanation

426
00:33:37,202 --> 00:33:40,160
for your grating obsession
with the white walkers

427
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:41,659
is that you're telling the truth

428
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,784
and that you saw
what you say you saw.

429
00:33:44,785 --> 00:33:47,660
So, you believe me.

430
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,492
I do.

431
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:52,202
You'll finish
weighing that heart?

432
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:57,327
That makes you the only person
south of the Twins who does.

433
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:03,201
We're not like the people
south of the Twins.

434
00:34:03,202 --> 00:34:05,410
And we're not like the
people north of the Twins.

435
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,660
In the Citadel, we lead different
lives for different reasons.

436
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:16,326
We are this world's memory,
Samwell Tarly.

437
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:19,285
Without us, men would be
little better than dogs.

438
00:34:19,286 --> 00:34:21,451
Don't remember
any meal but the last,

439
00:34:21,452 --> 00:34:24,118
can't see forward
to any but the next.

440
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,285
And every time you leave the
house and shut the door,

441
00:34:26,286 --> 00:34:29,201
they howl like
you're gone forever.

442
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:32,201
When Robert's Rebellion
was raging,

443
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:34,035
people thought the end was near.

444
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:37,118
The end of the Targaryen dynasty.
"How will we survive?"

445
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,576
When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward

446
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:42,534
and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush...

447
00:34:42,535 --> 00:34:44,576
"The end is near!
How will we survive?"

448
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:47,451
And thousands of years before
that, during the Long Night,

449
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,576
we can forgive them for
thinking it truly was the end.

450
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:52,286
But it wasn't.
None of it was.

451
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:56,618
The Wall has stood
through it all.

452
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,869
And every winter
that ever came has ended.

453
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:11,244
Be a good lad.
Clean this up.

454
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:02,744
Nope.

455
00:36:13,827 --> 00:36:14,869
Nope.

456
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,327
You're a lucky man.

457
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:36,660
I've heard she
beat the Hound in single combat.

458
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:42,952
She's a very impressive woman.

459
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,493
What do you want, Lord Baelish?

460
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:51,868
I want you to be happy.

461
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:54,243
I want you to be safe.

462
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:55,534
I am safe.

463
00:36:55,535 --> 00:36:58,701
I'm at home,
surrounded by friends.

464
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:02,077
I have Brienne to protect me
from anyone who would harm me.

465
00:37:05,952 --> 00:37:07,744
What about happy?

466
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,243
Why aren't you happy?

467
00:37:12,244 --> 00:37:14,201
What do you want
that you do not have?

468
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:16,951
At the moment, peace and quiet.

469
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:25,243
No need to seize the
last word, Lord Baelish.

470
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,618
I'll assume it was
something clever.

471
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:31,451
My lady.

472
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:33,244
My lady.

473
00:37:43,744 --> 00:37:45,285
Why is he still here?

474
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:48,035
We need his men.

475
00:37:48,036 --> 00:37:51,618
Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton
would still hold this castle.

476
00:37:53,077 --> 00:37:54,618
Littlefinger saved us.

477
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:00,410
He wants something.

478
00:38:02,202 --> 00:38:04,535
I know exactly what he wants.

479
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,285
♪ He rode through the
streets of the city ♪

480
00:38:13,286 --> 00:38:16,326
♪ Down from
his hill on high ♪

481
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,909
♪ O'er the winds and the steps
and the cobbles ♪

482
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,409
♪ He rode
to a woman's sigh ♪

483
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,617
♪ For she was
his secret treasure ♪

484
00:38:26,618 --> 00:38:30,035
♪ She was his shame
and his bliss ♪

485
00:38:30,036 --> 00:38:32,951
♪ And a chain and a keep
are nothing ♪

486
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:35,617
♪ Compared to
a woman's kiss ♪

487
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:39,118
♪ For hands of
gold are always cold ♪

488
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,784
♪ But a woman's hands
are warm ♪

489
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:45,617
♪ For hands of gold
are always cold ♪

490
00:38:45,618 --> 00:38:48,618
♪ But a woman's hands are... ♪

491
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,367
That's a pretty song.

492
00:38:51,368 --> 00:38:52,451
I've never heard it before.

493
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:53,909
It's a new one.

494
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,909
Are you hungry?
We've got some rabbit.

495
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,367
I don't want to steal your food.

496
00:38:58,368 --> 00:39:00,743
You're not stealing,
we're offering.

497
00:39:00,744 --> 00:39:03,119
Come on, it's gonna
be a cold night.

498
00:39:31,618 --> 00:39:33,118
You heading south?

499
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,201
King's Landing.

500
00:39:35,202 --> 00:39:37,285
Poor girl.

501
00:39:37,286 --> 00:39:39,951
Not so bad, is it?

502
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:42,076
Depends on your taste, I guess.

503
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:45,367
If you like your streets covered in shit
and pig's blood, it's the town for you.

504
00:39:45,368 --> 00:39:48,201
All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep,

505
00:39:48,202 --> 00:39:50,367
the Sept of Baelor,
the Dragonpit.

506
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:52,326
Then when I finally make it,

507
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:54,534
they wouldn't let me within
a mile of the Red Keep,

508
00:39:54,535 --> 00:39:56,492
the Sept of Baelor's
blown to hell,

509
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:58,451
and the Dragonpit
is a damn ruin.

510
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:00,326
The people who live there,

511
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:03,035
they'd skin you alive if they could
make two coppers off your hide.

512
00:40:03,036 --> 00:40:05,160
Worst place in the world.

513
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:07,534
What are you doing
in the Riverlands?

514
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:10,118
There's been some trouble with
the Freys up at the Twins,

515
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:13,452
so we're part of the army that's
been sent to keep the peace.

516
00:40:16,535 --> 00:40:19,367
Here you go.
Guests first.

517
00:40:19,368 --> 00:40:21,492
Oh, no, I couldn't.
You don't have enough.

518
00:40:21,493 --> 00:40:23,951
My mother always told me
to be kind to strangers.

519
00:40:23,952 --> 00:40:25,910
Strangers will be kind to you.

520
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,492
You're a long way from home.

521
00:40:40,493 --> 00:40:42,576
I'm sure you've had
some adventures, though.

522
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:45,409
Yeah, endless adventures.

523
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,076
They'll be singing about us for a thousand years.

524
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:51,743
The truth is when we left home,
we couldn't wait to get away.

525
00:40:51,744 --> 00:40:54,076
But now we've been gone a while,
we can't wait to get home.

526
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:58,118
I just think about my dad out
there on his boat all alone.

527
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,493
I ought to be
out there with him.

528
00:41:01,618 --> 00:41:03,451
My wife just had our first baby.

529
00:41:03,452 --> 00:41:05,743
- Boy or girl?
- Oh, who knows?

530
00:41:05,744 --> 00:41:07,909
You think soldiers get
ravens with news from home?

531
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,367
- I hope it's a girl.
- Why?

532
00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:17,326
Girls take care of their papas
when their papas grow old.

533
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:19,327
Boys just go off to fight
in someone else's wars.

534
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:23,910
Are you old
enough to drink?

535
00:41:39,368 --> 00:41:41,243
It's blackberry wine.

536
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:42,535
I made it myself.

537
00:41:43,994 --> 00:41:45,119
It's really good.

538
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:50,618
So, why is a nice girl on her
own heading to King's Landing?

539
00:41:58,161 --> 00:42:00,161
I'm going to kill the queen.

540
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:23,534
Bad night
to be outdoors.

541
00:42:23,535 --> 00:42:26,367
You've got real
powerful magic to figure that out.

542
00:42:26,368 --> 00:42:30,451
Did the Lord of Light
whisper that in your ear?

543
00:42:30,452 --> 00:42:33,617
"It's snowing, Thoros.
It's windy.

544
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:36,576
It's gonna be
a cold night."

545
00:42:36,577 --> 00:42:40,451
You're a grouchy old bear,
aren't you, Clegane?

546
00:42:40,452 --> 00:42:42,118
You want some rum?

547
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,201
Don't like that shit.
It's too sweet.

548
00:42:45,202 --> 00:42:47,244
Why are you always
in such a foul mood?

549
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,535
Experience.

550
00:42:55,702 --> 00:42:57,994
This seems like a good
place to spend the night.

551
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,076
These people don't want us here.

552
00:43:03,077 --> 00:43:05,993
Seems deserted to me.
No livestock.

553
00:43:05,994 --> 00:43:07,952
No smoke coming
from the chimney.

554
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:28,909
I don't like the look of it.

555
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,909
For a big, hard man,
you scare easy.

556
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,534
I'll tell you
what doesn't scare me...

557
00:43:34,535 --> 00:43:36,534
Bald cocksuckers like you.

558
00:43:36,535 --> 00:43:39,409
You think you're fooling
anyone with that top knot?

559
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,202
Bald cunt.

560
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:44,826
Come on.

561
00:43:44,827 --> 00:43:46,660
Maybe they've got
some ale hidden away.

562
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:49,784
They don't.

563
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:54,367
See if there's a larder.

564
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:56,077
They always leave
something behind.

565
00:44:37,744 --> 00:44:39,104
How do you think
it ended for them?

566
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,868
With death.

567
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:44,826
Girl died in her father's arms.

568
00:44:44,827 --> 00:44:47,660
Both of them covered in blood
and a knife at their feet.

569
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:51,784
I'd say they were starving.

570
00:44:51,785 --> 00:44:53,701
And rather than
let his little girl suffer,

571
00:44:53,702 --> 00:44:55,659
he ended it for both of them.

572
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,909
Doesn't matter now.

573
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,702
No, doesn't matter now.

574
00:45:14,452 --> 00:45:16,868
I've known you
a long time, Dondarrion.

575
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:18,367
Aye.

576
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:22,451
I think the first time we met
was at that tournament...

577
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:25,701
And I always thought
you were dull as dirt.

578
00:45:27,036 --> 00:45:28,784
You're not bad.

579
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:30,160
I don't hate you.

580
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:32,534
Don't like you,
but you're not bad.

581
00:45:32,535 --> 00:45:34,367
Thank you, Clegane.

582
00:45:34,368 --> 00:45:35,701
That warms the heart.

583
00:45:35,702 --> 00:45:38,367
But there's nothing
special about you.

584
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,201
You're right about that.

585
00:45:40,202 --> 00:45:43,660
So why does the Lord of Light
keep bringing you back?

586
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:47,035
I've met better men than you,

587
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:51,951
and they've been hanged from
crossbeams, or beheaded,

588
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:56,826
or just shat themselves to
death in a field somewhere.

589
00:45:56,827 --> 00:45:59,909
None of them came back.

590
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,492
So, why you?

591
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:04,409
You think I don't
ask myself that?

592
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:07,576
Every hour of every day?

593
00:46:07,577 --> 00:46:09,244
Why am I here?

594
00:46:10,618 --> 00:46:12,409
What am I supposed to do?

595
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:14,202
What does the Lord see in me?

596
00:46:16,202 --> 00:46:17,535
And?

597
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:21,909
I don't know.

598
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,909
I don't understand our Lord.

599
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,743
Your Lord.

600
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:27,534
I don't know
what He wants from me.

601
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:32,035
I only know that
He wants me alive.

602
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:36,327
If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he
just tell you what the fuck he wants?

603
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,201
Clegane.

604
00:46:40,202 --> 00:46:41,577
Come over here.

605
00:46:44,244 --> 00:46:45,952
Don't worry.
The fire won't bite.

606
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:50,243
I want to show you something.

607
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:53,452
It's my fucking luck I end up
with a band of fire worshippers.

608
00:46:54,618 --> 00:46:55,951
Aye.

609
00:46:55,952 --> 00:46:58,285
Almost seems like
divine justice.

610
00:46:58,286 --> 00:47:00,826
There's no divine justice,
you dumb cunt.

611
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:03,951
If there was, you'd be dead...

612
00:47:03,952 --> 00:47:06,119
and that girl would be alive.

613
00:47:12,493 --> 00:47:15,326
- What do you want?
- Look into the flames.

614
00:47:15,327 --> 00:47:17,451
I don't want to look
in the damn flames.

615
00:47:17,452 --> 00:47:20,994
You saw me bring him back from
the dead after you cut him down.

616
00:47:22,618 --> 00:47:24,868
Don't you want to know
what gave me the power?

617
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:28,326
I keep asking and no
one wants to tell me.

618
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:29,826
We can't tell you.

619
00:47:29,827 --> 00:47:31,994
Only the fire can tell you.

620
00:47:44,577 --> 00:47:46,036
What do you see?

621
00:47:47,785 --> 00:47:49,243
Logs burning.

622
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:51,327
Keep looking.

623
00:47:56,994 --> 00:47:58,202
What do you see?

624
00:48:07,702 --> 00:48:10,409
Ice.

625
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,327
A wall of ice.

626
00:48:14,744 --> 00:48:15,744
The Wall.

627
00:48:18,535 --> 00:48:19,784
What else?

628
00:48:19,785 --> 00:48:23,994
It's where the Wall
meets the sea.

629
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,410
There's a castle there.

630
00:48:34,827 --> 00:48:36,326
There's a mountain.

631
00:48:36,327 --> 00:48:39,785
Looks like an arrowhead.

632
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,577
The dead are marching past.

633
00:48:49,535 --> 00:48:51,368
Thousands of them.

634
00:48:57,493 --> 00:48:58,910
Do you believe me now, Clegane?

635
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:02,535
Do you believe
we're here for a reason?

636
00:49:34,202 --> 00:49:35,785
What the hell
are you doing, Clegane?

637
00:49:39,202 --> 00:49:40,785
Burying the dead.

638
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:55,993
You knew these people.

639
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:57,493
Not really.

640
00:50:57,994 --> 00:51:01,826
We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy.

641
00:51:01,827 --> 00:51:04,869
We ask the Mother to...

642
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:09,869
Fuck it, I don't
remember the rest.

643
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:19,367
I'm sorry you're dead.

644
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:22,285
You deserved better.

645
00:51:22,286 --> 00:51:23,286
Both of you.

646
00:51:47,244 --> 00:51:48,909
Hey.

647
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:55,492
Mom.

648
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:57,244
You should really sleep, Sam.

649
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,244
The dead don't.

650
00:52:09,452 --> 00:52:12,618
"Legends of the Long Night."

651
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:17,617
The Targaryens used dragonglass
to decorate their weapons

652
00:52:17,618 --> 00:52:20,161
without even knowing what
the First Men used it for.

653
00:52:37,452 --> 00:52:38,452
What is it?

654
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:42,201
It's a map of Dragonstone.

655
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:44,492
The Targaryens built
their first stronghold there

656
00:52:44,493 --> 00:52:46,286
when they invaded Westeros.

657
00:52:48,994 --> 00:52:50,743
That's dragonglass?

658
00:52:50,744 --> 00:52:52,492
A mountain of it.

659
00:52:52,493 --> 00:52:53,659
Beneath the ground.

660
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,993
Stannis told me,
but I didn't think...

661
00:52:55,994 --> 00:52:59,493
This is important.
Jon needs to know.

662
00:53:52,785 --> 00:53:54,868
Has she come yet?

663
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:56,492
Who?

664
00:53:56,493 --> 00:53:58,701
The Dragon Queen.

665
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,660
Daenerys Stormborn.

666
00:54:02,368 --> 00:54:03,577
Haven't heard anything.

667
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,576
Shall we begin?

668
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:08,660
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

669
01:01:09,827 --> 01:01:12,409
The Mad King's
daughter will destroy the realm.

670
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,161
We have an army
of fleets and three dragons.

671
01:01:15,785 --> 01:01:17,660
We should hit
King's Landing now.
