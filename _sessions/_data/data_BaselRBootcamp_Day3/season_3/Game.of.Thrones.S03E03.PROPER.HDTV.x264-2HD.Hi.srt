1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,126
This march is a distraction.

2
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:05,905
Robb: My grandfather's funeral
is not a distraction.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,774
- Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
- No.

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,277
Then it's a distraction.

5
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:12,813
- They're growing fast.
- Not fast enough.

6
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:15,215
- ( screeches )
- I need an army.

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,984
Jorah: <i>We'll be in Astapor</i>
<i>by nightfall.</i>

8
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:19,754
<i>Some say the Unsullied are the</i>
<i>greatest soldiers in the world.</i>

9
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:21,723
Daenerys: <i>The greatest slave-soldiers</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

10
00:00:21,757 --> 00:00:24,492
Arya: <i>Who are you?</i>
- Thoros of Myr.

11
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:26,962
- Who do you fight for?
- <i>The Brotherhood without Banners.</i>

12
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:29,097
The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.

13
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:30,566
We're trying to save it.

14
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:35,772
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?

15
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:38,175
I'll come for you tonight
when the castle sleeps.

16
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:40,778
I have been searching
for you, Daenerys Stormborn,

17
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:42,145
to ask your forgiveness.

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,982
I am Barristan Selmy,
Kingsguard to your father.

19
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:46,850
I will not fail you again.

20
00:00:46,884 --> 00:00:49,119
- Jon: <i>What's wrong with him?</i>
- Mance: <i>He's a warg.</i>

21
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:51,855
<i>He can enter the mind of animals,</i>
<i>see through their eyes.</i>

22
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:53,657
He's scouting for us.

23
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:55,592
Orell, where were you
this time?

24
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:57,494
The Fist of the First Men.

25
00:00:57,528 --> 00:00:59,797
- What did you see?
- Dead crows.

26
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:03,501
Get up, Tarly.
I forbid you to die.

27
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:05,337
You're responsible for him.

28
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:07,406
<i>Make sure he gets back alive.</i>

29
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:10,777
So good to see you
again, Clegane.

30
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:13,413
- ( men laugh )
- Girl.

31
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:14,948
What in seven hells

32
00:01:14,982 --> 00:01:17,150
are you doing
with the Stark bitch?

33
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:18,719
Brienne:
Get up.

34
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:23,857
- Ah!
- ( horse neighs )

35
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:26,159
Let us go and my father will pay
you whatever you want.

36
00:01:26,193 --> 00:01:28,828
Enough to buy me a new head?

37
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:38,774

Edmure:
<i>If I may, nephew,</i>

45
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:38,916
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

46
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:41,152
at the Stone Mill
which may have some bearing--

47
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:44,488
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

48
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:47,357
And don't call him "nephew."
He is your king.

49
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,825
Robb knows
I meant him no disr--

50
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:52,362
You're lucky I'm not your king.

51
00:05:52,397 --> 00:05:54,561
I wouldn't let you wave
your blunders around

52
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:56,100
like a victory flag.

53
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,736
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog

54
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:01,906
scurrying back to Casterly Rock with
his tail between his legs.

55
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:04,076
I think King Robb understands
we're not gonna win this war

56
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,744
if he's the only one
winning any battles.

57
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,259
No, there's glory enough
to go around.

58
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,148
It's not about glory.

59
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:13,586
Your instructions were to wait
for him to come to you.

60
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,054
I seized an opportunity.

61
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,989
What value was the mill?

62
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:19,224
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

63
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,592
Robb:
<i>Is he there now?</i>

64
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:22,828
Of course not.
We took the fight to him.

65
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:24,095
He could not withstand us.

66
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,331
I wanted to draw
the Mountain into the west,

67
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:31,569
into our country where
we could surround him and kill him.

68
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:33,705
I wanted him to chase us,

69
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:37,208
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

70
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:39,443
without a strategic thought
in his head.

71
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:42,480
I could have that head
on a spike by now.

72
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:47,352
Instead, I have a mill.

73
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:51,756
Edmure:
<i>We took hostages.</i>

74
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,493
Willem Lannister.
Martyn Lannister.

75
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:58,030
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

76
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:00,499
Martyn is 15, I believe.

77
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,908
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

78
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:09,876
Have I sued for peace?

79
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:11,411
No.

80
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:12,846
Do you think
he'll sue for peace

81
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,983
because we have his father's

82
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:18,885
brother's
great-grandsons?

83
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:25,058
No.

84
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:27,093
How many men did you lose?

85
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:29,829
208.

86
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:32,131
But for every man we lost,
the Lannisters--

87
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:35,101
We need our men more
than Tywin needs his!

88
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:43,243
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:45,646
- I didn't know.
- You would have.

90
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,916
Right here today at this gathering
if you had been patient.

91
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,252
We seem to be running
short of patience here.

92
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:54,721
You know who isn't?

93
00:07:56,323 --> 00:07:58,991
Tywin Lannister.

94
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:02,061
( chains rattling )

95
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:29,951
<i>( chair squeaking )</i>

96
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:49,773
( sighs )

97
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:52,442
Intimate.
Lovely table.

98
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:55,278
<i>Better chairs than the old</i>
<i>small council chamber.</i>

99
00:09:55,313 --> 00:09:58,748
Conveniently close
to your own quarters. I like it.

100
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,618
What news of Jaime?

101
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:07,890
20,000 unwashed Northerners

102
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:09,959
have known about
his escape for weeks.

103
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:12,361
<i>Collectively, you control</i>
<i>more spies and informants</i>

104
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:14,296
than the rest
of the world combined.

105
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:16,232
Do you mean to tell me
that none of you

106
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:18,368
has any notion of where he is?

107
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:21,371
- We are trying, my lord.
- Try harder.

108
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,642
<i>What do we have, then?</i>

109
00:10:25,677 --> 00:10:28,546
Robb Stark and most of his
bannermen are in Riverrun

110
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,349
for the funeral of his grandfather
Lord Hoster Tully.

111
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:37,487
In Stark's absence,
Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,

112
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:41,090
which would seem to make
him Lord of Harrenhal,

113
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,244
- in practice if not in name.
- <i>Well, let him have it.</i>

114
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,126
The name suits our purposes

115
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:48,163
far more than that
useless pile of rubble.

116
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,299
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a
worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

117
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:54,269
For which I am extremely
grateful to you, my lord.

118
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:56,905
<i>Lady Arryn and I have known</i>
<i>each other since we were children.</i>

119
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:59,407
She has always been...

120
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,976
positively predisposed
toward me.

121
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:05,313
A successful courtship
would make Lord Baelish

122
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:07,148
acting Lord of the Vale.

123
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:10,018
Titles do seem to breed titles.

124
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:12,220
You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible

125
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,022
and bring Lysa Arryn
into the fold.

126
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:17,058
Then the young wolf can add
his own aunt to the list

127
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,927
of people who have
taken up arms against him.

128
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:21,764
Far be it from me
to hinder true love,

129
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:26,335
<i>but Lord Baelish's absence</i>
<i>would present certain problems.</i>

130
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:28,270
The royal wedding may end up

131
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:31,173
being the most expensive
event in living memory.

132
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,343
<i>Summer has ended,</i>
<i>hard days lie ahead.</i>

133
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:38,214
Not a good time to leave the
crown's finances unattended.

134
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:40,416
Tywin:
<i>Fully agreed.</i>

135
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,553
Which is why I'm naming you
new Master of Coin.

136
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:45,488
- ( chuckles )
- Master of Coin?

137
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:48,157
It would appear to be a position
that best suits your talents.

138
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:50,126
I'm quite good
at spending money,

139
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:52,128
but a lifetime
of outrageous wealth

140
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:53,864
hasn't taught me much
about managing it.

141
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:57,534
I have no doubt you will
prove equal to this challenge.

142
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:59,269
Hear, hear.

143
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:02,540
Man: <i>♪ He lifted her</i>
<i>high in the air ♪</i>

144
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:04,775
♪ He sniffed and roared
and smelled her there ♪

145
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,144
♪ She kicked and wailed,
a maid so fair ♪

146
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:09,746
♪ But he licked the honey

147
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:12,516
All: ♪ From there to here,

148
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,651
♪ All black and brown
and covered with hair ♪

149
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:16,820
♪ He smelled that girl

150
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:20,023
♪ The bear, the bear

151
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:23,059
I hope you're pleased.

152
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:25,561
If you had armed me,
they never would have taken us.

153
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:27,563
You were armed
when we were taken.

154
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:29,265
I was in chains if you recall.

155
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,200
Our little match would
have ended quite quick

156
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:33,168
if my hands weren't bound.

157
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:36,505
All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

158
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:39,208
what a brilliant swordsman."

159
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:41,543
You were slower
than I expected.

160
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:43,312
And more predictable.

161
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,913
I've been sitting
in a muddy pen

162
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:46,749
wrapped in chains
for the past year.

163
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:48,718
And I'm a woman.
I was still beating you.

164
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:51,187
You were not beating me.

165
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:53,389
Maybe you were as good
as people said...

166
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:55,491
once.

167
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,594
Or maybe people just love
to overpraise a famous name.

168
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:01,498
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

169
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,068
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped.

170
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:06,636
More than once.

171
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:09,840
None of these fellows have
ever been with a noblewoman.

172
00:13:12,076 --> 00:13:13,744
You'd be wise not to resist.

173
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:15,846
- Would I?
- They'll knock your teeth out.

174
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,347
You think I care
about my teeth?

175
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:20,617
No, I don't think you
care about your teeth.

176
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:25,622
If you fight them,
they will kill you.

177
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:27,357
Do you understand?

178
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:30,127
I'm the prisoner
of value, not you.

179
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:32,462
Let them have what they want.
What does it matter?

180
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:34,698
- What does it matter?
- Close your eyes.

181
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:36,533
Pretend they're Renly.

182
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:40,570
If you were a woman,
you wouldn't resist?

183
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:42,905
You'd let them
do what they wanted?

184
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,942
If I was a woman,
I'd make them kill me.

185
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:48,344
But I'm not, thank the gods.

186
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:54,984
If I had a proper forge,
I could make it good as new.

187
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,919
Doesn't have to look pretty.

188
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:59,355
It just has to keep
the arrows out of my heart.

189
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,524
Why are you helping him?

190
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,759
He takes us prisoner
and now he's our friend?

191
00:14:03,794 --> 00:14:05,395
Thoros: <i>You're not our prisoner,</i>
<i>little lady.</i>

192
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,564
- What am I?
- Our guest.

193
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,666
No one's put any chains on you.

194
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,435
So I can walk away, then?

195
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:14,271
These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.

196
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:16,573
You're lucky we found you.

197
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:24,047
Hound: You think you're good with
that bow, you little twat?

198
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:25,648
Anguy: Better than anyone
you've ever met.

199
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,616
Hound:
<i>A coward's weapon.</i>

200
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:29,785
<i>I like to fight up close.</i>

201
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,256
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

202
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,626
Why?
So you can kiss him?

203
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,761
You remember the last time
you were here?

204
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:41,332
Looks like every other
shit inn on the road.

205
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,968
Now, apologies,
but you're one ugly fucker

206
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:46,204
and I'd rather not
see you no more.

207
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:50,609
( grunts )

208
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:52,610
Watch your head.

209
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:54,045
- ( bangs wagon )
- Off we go.

210
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,382
- Man: <i>Walk up!</i>
- <i>( horse neighs )</i>

211
00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:03,487
What are you doing?
We're about to leave.

212
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:04,988
I'm staying.

213
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:09,560
You're what?

214
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:11,862
I baked some brown bread
for the innkeep

215
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:13,731
and she said
she never had better.

216
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:15,633
Told Thoros she's keeping me
as a payment

217
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,135
for all the free meals
she's given him.

218
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:19,337
Anyway, it's not me
the Brotherhood wants.

219
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:21,806
My brother ain't no king.

220
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:23,474
I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.

221
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:24,909
Winterfell.

222
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:28,412
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

223
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:33,584
Well, I made you something.

224
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,891
What is it?

225
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:42,160
It's a wolf.

226
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:48,232
Yes, it is.

227
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:50,868
That's the tail?

228
00:15:50,902 --> 00:15:52,403
Yeah.

229
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,774
Well, be safe.

230
00:15:56,808 --> 00:15:58,643
Yeah, you, too.

231
00:15:58,677 --> 00:16:00,378
Don't get stabbed.

232
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:03,314
You don't...

233
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:05,183
burn your fingers.

234
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:17,662
Good-bye, Hot Pie.

235
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:19,964
Good-bye, Arry.

236
00:16:30,944 --> 00:16:32,879
Up you go, little lady.

237
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:42,587
Arya:
<i>Hey, Hot Pie.</i>

238
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:45,890
It's really good.

239
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:54,532
A person could
almost be forgiven

240
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:56,767
for forgetting we're at war.

241
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:03,607
It often comforts me to think
that even in war's darkest days,

242
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:05,476
in most places in the world

243
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,779
absolutely nothing
is happening.

244
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,151
I've missed you, Uncle.

245
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:16,153
Father missed you, too,

246
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:18,088
from the day you left.

247
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:20,290
Maybe he never said it
in so many words--

248
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:21,926
Maybe?

249
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,228
Your father
was a stubborn old ox.

250
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:26,030
I was surprised when he died.

251
00:17:26,064 --> 00:17:28,833
Didn't think death
had the patience.

252
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,772
I'm glad you were with him.

253
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:35,673
I wish to the gods I had been.

254
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:41,079
Did you make peace in the end?

255
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:43,915
After 30 years of fighting,

256
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:46,351
I don't think he remembered
what started it.

257
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:50,121
He asked me to stop
calling myself Blackfish.

258
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:52,323
He said it was an old joke

259
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:54,859
and it was never funny
to begin with.

260
00:17:56,362 --> 00:17:58,897
I told him people had been
calling me Blackfish

261
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:01,800
for so long, they don't
remember my real name.

262
00:18:05,872 --> 00:18:08,140
Every time he would leave
for the capital

263
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:10,909
or fight in a campaign,

264
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:13,077
I'd see him off.

265
00:18:13,112 --> 00:18:16,213
"Wait for me,
little Cat," he'd say.

266
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:19,416
"Wait for me

267
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:22,920
and I'll come back
to you."

268
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:25,489
And I would sit at this window

269
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:28,259
every day when the sun
came up, waiting.

270
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:34,431
I wonder

271
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:37,200
how many times
did Bran or Rickon

272
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:39,169
stare across the moors
of Winterfell

273
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,371
waiting for me to return.

274
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:44,874
<i>I will never see them again.</i>

275
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:47,310
( crying )

276
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:50,046
You mustn't think it.

277
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,381
We don't know the truth.

278
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,084
They could be in hiding.

279
00:18:58,122 --> 00:19:00,891
Robb believes they're alive.

280
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:03,060
And he must go on believing.

281
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:05,863
He's got to remain strong
if he's to prevail.

282
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:09,967
And you must remain
strong for him.

283
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,746
You're Robb Stark's wife.

284
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:25,249
Hold still.

285
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:28,519
Is it true
what they say about him?

286
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:32,122
I don't know.
What do they say about him?

287
00:19:32,157 --> 00:19:34,425
That he can turn
into a wolf at night.

288
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:37,161
True.

289
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:39,430
And he eats the flesh
of his enemies.

290
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:41,432
True.

291
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:46,403
You're a Lannister, aren't you?

292
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:47,637
Martyn Lannister.

293
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:50,807
Martyn Lannister.

294
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:52,108
You've nothing to fear.

295
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:54,277
My husband
doesn't eat children.

296
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:58,381
Unless it's a full moon.

297
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,217
It's not a full moon
tonight, is it?

298
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:03,019
See?

299
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:05,289
Nothing to fear.

300
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:07,658
( fabric rips )

301
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:09,293
<i>( wind howling )</i>

302
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:25,810
Always the artists.

303
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,668
It's only horses.

304
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:49,302
No men.

305
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:53,040
You said there was dead crows.

306
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:55,409
There was.

307
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:59,213
How many men were here?

308
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:01,449
About 300.

309
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,884
And you know
what those men are now?

310
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:10,958
We're all the same to them--
meat for their army.

311
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,895
Do you think anyone got away?

312
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:16,430
Mance:
<i>It's not impossible.</i>

313
00:21:16,465 --> 00:21:18,832
<i>You don't go far</i>
<i>betting against Mormont.</i>

314
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:21,168
But dead or alive,

315
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:23,337
he took a big gamble
coming north.

316
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:25,438
<i>And he lost.</i>

317
00:21:25,473 --> 00:21:27,807
His best fighting men are dead.

318
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:31,044
And whether he's Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch

319
00:21:31,078 --> 00:21:33,046
or a blue-eyed corpse,

320
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,882
he's a long way from home.

321
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:38,284
Tormund.

322
00:21:38,352 --> 00:21:40,320
Climb the Wall.

323
00:21:40,354 --> 00:21:43,423
Take Orell and 20 good men.

324
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:45,058
And take this one.

325
00:21:45,092 --> 00:21:47,927
He knows Castle Black's
defenses better than any of us.

326
00:21:47,962 --> 00:21:50,363
And if he's useful, good.
If not...

327
00:21:50,398 --> 00:21:52,799
throw him off the Wall.

328
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,735
See if crows can fly.

329
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:59,072
We're finally going to war,
old friend?

330
00:21:59,106 --> 00:22:00,674
Hide near Castle Black.

331
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,009
When I give the signal,
hit them in the night.

332
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:05,745
They've got a big old wall
to hide behind,

333
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:07,614
but it only guards one side.

334
00:22:07,648 --> 00:22:09,015
( chuckles )

335
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,817
- We'll meet again.
- Aye.

336
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:13,019
- If you do your job.
- Ah.

337
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:15,222
How will we see your signal?

338
00:22:15,256 --> 00:22:17,958
Send your eagle above
the Wall every night.

339
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:20,761
When it's time, I'm going
to light the biggest fire

340
00:22:20,796 --> 00:22:22,997
the North has ever seen.

341
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:25,734
( coughing )

342
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,075
<i>( donkey braying )</i>

343
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:38,013
<i>( women chatting )</i>

344
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:40,549
<i>( pigs squealing )</i>

345
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:51,828
Ghost?

346
00:23:05,075 --> 00:23:08,777
What have we here?
Frozen crows?

347
00:23:08,812 --> 00:23:10,813
We've come a long way.

348
00:23:13,117 --> 00:23:15,585
Craster: <i>Smaller flock</i>
<i>than you went north with.</i>

349
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:17,721
We can talk inside.

350
00:23:17,755 --> 00:23:20,857
Oh, can we?

351
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,446
- <i>( woman wailing )</i>
- Woman #2: <i>They need some water.</i>

352
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,649
<i>Tether it and I'll be inside.</i>

353
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:48,319
<i>( children coughing )</i>

354
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,823
<i>( woman moaning )</i>

00:23:52,857 --> 00:23:54,491
<i>( pigs squealing )</i>

356
00:23:54,526 --> 00:23:57,427
<i>( woman continues moaning )</i>

357
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:03,432
Craster: <i>Keep your eyes</i>
<i>where they belong.</i>

358
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:06,001
They're not for you.

359
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:08,503
Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.

360
00:24:08,538 --> 00:24:11,974
Aye, pig's got value to me.

361
00:24:12,008 --> 00:24:15,877
You should all be kissing
my feet for letting you in.

362
00:24:17,213 --> 00:24:20,049
I'd have turned you all away
if I wasn't a godly man.

363
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,417
You are a godly man?

364
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:25,888
I am.
I got no fear of what's out there.

365
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,923
<i>When the white cold comes,</i>

366
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:32,094
<i>your swords and cloaks</i>
<i>and bloody fires won't help you.</i>

367
00:24:32,128 --> 00:24:36,365
The only ones left will be
those who are right with the gods.

368
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:37,966
The real gods.

369
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,736
<i>( woman wailing )</i>

370
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,241
Go tell her she can
bite down on a rag

371
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,944
or she can bite down
on my fist.

372
00:24:52,015 --> 00:24:55,451
Women.
( chuckles )

373
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:57,353
That sow right there gave birth

374
00:24:57,387 --> 00:24:59,688
<i>to a litter of eight.</i>

375
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:01,857
Barely a grunt.

376
00:25:01,892 --> 00:25:06,228
And she's almost as fat
as this one here.

377
00:25:06,263 --> 00:25:08,831
Now why don't you dine on him?

378
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:11,500
Carve off what you need
as you go.

379
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:14,669
Well, look at him.
He's a walking feast.

380
00:25:16,805 --> 00:25:19,107
( squeals )

381
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:22,276
( Craster laughing )

382
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:34,155
- <i>( woman continues wailing )</i>
- Woman #2: <i>Here we are.</i>

383
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:36,558
<i>Sharpen these for me, would ya?</i>

384
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:48,771
<i>( woman continues wailing )</i>

385
00:25:54,444 --> 00:25:56,145
Woman #3: <i>I see the head.</i>
<i>Push.</i>

386
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,947
- ( wailing )
- That's it.

387
00:25:58,982 --> 00:26:01,317
<i>You're nearly there.</i>

388
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,723
One more push should do it.

389
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:10,193
( wailing )

390
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:14,464
<i>( baby crying )</i>

391
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:20,037
What is it?
What is it?

392
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:33,817
<i>( water dripping )</i>

393
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:36,320
<i>( door opens )</i>

394
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:49,166
( breathing heavily )

395
00:26:52,003 --> 00:26:54,004
Keep quiet.

396
00:26:57,643 --> 00:26:59,110
( groans )

397
00:27:19,498 --> 00:27:21,700
( groans )

398
00:27:23,236 --> 00:27:26,071
If you can't ride,
we don't stand a chance.

399
00:27:26,106 --> 00:27:28,140
I can ride.

400
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:30,443
You're sure?

401
00:27:34,115 --> 00:27:35,482
( groans )

402
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:43,956
( groans )

403
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,225
Ride east.
Follow the rising sun.

404
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:48,661
<i>Your sister's waiting for you.</i>

405
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:51,396
I'll make you a Lord
of the Iron Islands for this.

406
00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:52,591
We're not in the Iron Islands.

407
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:55,167
- Go.
- Come on.

408
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:56,802
Come on.
Come on.

409
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:58,770
Come on. Come on.

410
00:28:02,675 --> 00:28:04,643
Man:
<i>Come on back.</i>

411
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:10,548
Stannis: <i>You refuse to tell me</i>
<i>where you're going?</i>

412
00:28:10,616 --> 00:28:13,684
Melisandre: <i>I don't know yet.</i>
<i>The fires will show me.</i>

413
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:16,453
- How long will you be gone?
- I don't know.

414
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:19,156
You're abandoning me.

415
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,358
I will never abandon you.

416
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,329
You are the Son of Fire.

417
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:27,898
- I am sworn to serve you.
- Then serve me.

418
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:30,100
When I return,
you will understand.

419
00:28:32,537 --> 00:28:34,705
My enemies think
they've destroyed me.

420
00:28:36,608 --> 00:28:38,776
They're laughing at me

421
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:42,313
the way Renly laughed at me.

422
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:44,915
I want Joffrey dead.

423
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,452
I want Robb Stark dead.

424
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,057
Make me another son.

425
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:54,692
I cannot.

426
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:55,927
Why?

427
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:58,997
You don't have the strength.
It would kill you.

428
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:01,900
I'm not so easily killed.
Men have been trying for years.

429
00:29:06,706 --> 00:29:09,074
I want you.

430
00:29:22,324 --> 00:29:25,660
Your fires burn low, my king.

431
00:29:28,797 --> 00:29:32,600
There is another way.
A better way.

432
00:29:32,634 --> 00:29:35,202
You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.

433
00:29:35,236 --> 00:29:36,837
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

434
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:38,438
You are.

435
00:29:38,473 --> 00:29:40,707
But there are others
with your blood in their veins.

436
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:45,913
You will sit
on the Iron Throne,

437
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:48,082
but first there must
be sacrifices.

438
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:50,918
The Lord of Light demands it.

439
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:58,559
<i>( birds screeching )</i>

440
00:30:02,364 --> 00:30:04,865
The Walk of Punishment
is a warning, Your Grace.

441
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:08,001
- To whom?
- To any slave who contemplates doing

442
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:10,703
whatever these slaves did.

443
00:30:10,737 --> 00:30:13,239
Give me your water.

444
00:30:13,273 --> 00:30:16,976
Khaleesi, this man
has been sentenced to death.

445
00:30:22,616 --> 00:30:25,251
Here, drink.

446
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:27,554
( mutters )

447
00:30:27,588 --> 00:30:29,822
Barristan:
<i>Leave this place, Your Grace.</i>

448
00:30:29,857 --> 00:30:31,424
Leave tonight, I beg you.

449
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:32,959
And what is she
to do for soldiers?

450
00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:36,462
Barristan: <i>We can find sellswords</i>
<i>in Pentos and Myr.</i>

451
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,966
Is it "we" already,
Ser Barristan?

452
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,803
If you want to sit on the throne your
ancestors built, you must win it.

453
00:30:43,837 --> 00:30:46,039
That will mean blood on your
hands before the thing is done.

454
00:30:46,073 --> 00:30:49,275
The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.

455
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,814
Jorah: How many wars have you
fought in, Ser Barristan?

456
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:57,082
- Three.
- Have you ever seen a war

457
00:30:57,117 --> 00:30:59,485
where innocents didn't die
by the thousands?

458
00:31:04,157 --> 00:31:07,193
I was in King's Landing
after the sack, khaleesi.

459
00:31:07,227 --> 00:31:10,362
You know what I saw?
Butchery.

460
00:31:10,397 --> 00:31:12,765
Babies, children, old men.

461
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:15,201
More women raped
than you can count.

462
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:16,835
There's a beast in every man

463
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,839
and it stirs when you put
a sword in his hand.

464
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:22,241
But the Unsullied are not men.

465
00:31:22,275 --> 00:31:23,909
They do not rape.

466
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:27,013
They do not put cities to the sword
unless they're ordered to do so.

467
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:31,717
If you buy them, the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.

468
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:33,218
Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?

469
00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:36,322
When your brother Rhaegar led
his army into battle at the Trident,

470
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:38,991
men died for him
because they believed in him,

471
00:31:39,025 --> 00:31:40,726
because they loved him,

472
00:31:40,761 --> 00:31:43,229
not because they'd been bought
at a slaver's auction.

473
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:47,800
I fought beside the last dragon
on that day, Your Grace.

474
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:51,638
I bled beside him.

475
00:31:51,672 --> 00:31:55,208
Rhaegar fought valiantly,
Rhaegar fought nobly,

476
00:31:55,242 --> 00:31:57,077
and Rhaegar died.

477
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,648
Did you know him well,
Ser Barristan?

478
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:05,219
I did, Your Grace.
Finest man I ever met.

479
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:07,455
I wish I had known him.

480
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:09,523
But he was not the last dragon.

481
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21,515
All?

482
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,136
Did this one's ears
mishear, Your Grace?

483
00:32:24,674 --> 00:32:26,909
They did not.
I want to buy them all.

484
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:29,111
_

485
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:31,421
_

486
00:32:31,937 --> 00:32:35,263
_

487
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:40,856
_

488
00:32:41,724 --> 00:32:45,194
There are 8,000 Unsullied
in Astapor.

489
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:46,962
Is this what you mean by all?

490
00:32:46,996 --> 00:32:48,897
Yes. 8,000.

491
00:32:48,965 --> 00:32:51,233
<i>And the ones</i>
<i>still in training as well.</i>

492
00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:56,265
_

493
00:32:56,385 --> 00:32:59,496
_

494
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:04,013
Master Greizhen says they
cannot sell half-trained boys.

495
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,348
<i>If they fail</i>
<i>on the battlefield,</i>

496
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:08,617
they will bring shame
upon all of Astapor.

497
00:33:08,651 --> 00:33:10,519
I will have them all
or take none.

498
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:11,744
Many will fall in battle.

499
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:13,821
I'll need the boys to pick
up the swords they drop.

500
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:16,291
( groans )

501
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,675
_

502
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:21,684
Master Kraznys says
you cannot afford this.

503
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:25,115
_

504
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:28,804
Your ship will buy you
100 Unsullied.

505
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:33,676
- ( men laugh )
- Because Master Kraznys is generous.

506
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:38,606
<i>The gold you have left</i>
<i>is worth 10.</i>

507
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:41,917
But good Master Kraznys
will give you 20.

508
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:46,488
The Dothraki
you have with you--

509
00:33:47,203 --> 00:33:50,312
_

510
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:54,630
The Dothraki you have are not
worth what they cost to feed,

511
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:57,199
<i>but Master Kraznys will give</i>
<i>you three Unsullied</i>

512
00:33:57,233 --> 00:33:58,801
<i>for all of them.</i>

513
00:33:58,921 --> 00:33:59,983
_

514
00:34:00,103 --> 00:34:02,938
Master Kraznys asks
how you propose to pay

515
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:08,578
for the remaining
7,877 Unsullied.

516
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:16,519
I have dragons.
I'll give you one.

517
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:20,390
( speaking Valyrian )

518
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:23,293
You will win the throne
with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.

519
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:26,028
Khaleesi, please.

520
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,672
Three dragons.

521
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:37,974
- One.
- Two.

522
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,342
One.

523
00:34:44,314 --> 00:34:46,348
( whispering )

524
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:49,818
( speaks Valyrian )

525
00:34:49,852 --> 00:34:52,087
Missandei:
<i>They want the biggest one.</i>

526
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:54,556
- Done.
- Done.

527
00:34:59,261 --> 00:35:01,930
I'll take you as well, now.

528
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:04,900
You'll be Master
Kraznys' gift to me.

529
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:07,069
A token of a bargain
well struck.

530
00:35:08,094 --> 00:35:12,197
_

531
00:35:12,317 --> 00:35:17,660
_

532
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,915
Khaleesi, a dragon is worth
more than any army.

533
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,218
Aegon Targaryen proved that.

534
00:35:24,787 --> 00:35:26,821
You're both here to advise me.

535
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:28,842
I value your advice,
but if you ever question me

536
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:30,392
in front of strangers again,

537
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:32,927
you'll be advising
someone else.

538
00:35:32,962 --> 00:35:35,263
Is that understood?

539
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,734
<i>Do you have a name?</i>

540
00:35:39,768 --> 00:35:42,403
This one's name
is Missandei, Your Grace.

541
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:44,639
Do you have a family?
A mother and a father

542
00:35:44,673 --> 00:35:46,674
you'd return to
if you had the choice?

543
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:50,011
No, Your Grace.
No family living.

544
00:35:50,045 --> 00:35:53,181
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.

545
00:35:53,215 --> 00:35:55,783
Yes, Your Grace.
Lying is a great offense.

546
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:59,187
Many of those on the Walk of Punishment
were taken there for less.

547
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:01,942
I offered water to one of the slaves
dying on the Walk of Punishment.

548
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:05,226
Do you know what he said to me?
"Let me die."

549
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,129
There are no masters
in the grave, Your Grace.

550
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:10,798
Is it true what
Master Kraznys told me

551
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:13,968
about the Unsullied?
About their obedience?

552
00:36:14,036 --> 00:36:16,537
All questions have been
taken from them.

553
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:18,438
They obey, that is all.

554
00:36:18,472 --> 00:36:21,241
<i>Once they are yours,</i>
<i>they are yours.</i>

555
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:23,342
They will fall on their swords
if you command it.

556
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:26,846
And what about you?
You know that I'm taking you to war.

557
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,016
<i>You may go hungry.</i>
<i>You may fall sick.</i>

558
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:33,185
You may be killed.

559
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,921
<i>Valar morghulis.</i>

560
00:36:34,955 --> 00:36:38,524
Yes, all men must die.

561
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,694
But we are not men.

562
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:55,174
Tyrion: <i>A surprising place to keep</i>
<i>the royal ledgers.</i>

563
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:57,310
Littlefinger:
<i>I'm surprised you're surprised.</i>

564
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:02,348
This is the safest place
in the city.

565
00:37:02,383 --> 00:37:04,284
Not for bastards.

566
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:06,620
That's all of them, my lord.

567
00:37:06,654 --> 00:37:09,757
Tyrion: <i>Thank you, my dear.</i>
<i>Pod.</i>

568
00:37:10,725 --> 00:37:12,960
Pod.
Take them outside.

569
00:37:12,994 --> 00:37:15,696
- I'll be there in a moment.
- Yes, my lord.

570
00:37:26,474 --> 00:37:29,744
I hear you owe that boy
a significant debt.

571
00:37:29,778 --> 00:37:31,579
Only my life.

572
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:33,547
Not all that significant,
I'm afraid.

573
00:37:33,615 --> 00:37:35,616
You should have him knighted.

574
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,819
If only the Master of Coin
had such power.

575
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:41,922
If only.

576
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:46,060
I owe you a significant debt.

577
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:48,462
Our redheaded friend.

578
00:37:48,496 --> 00:37:51,264
You secured her release
when the queen detained her.

579
00:37:51,298 --> 00:37:53,266
Oh, that.

580
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:56,469
Of course.
A simple misunderstanding.

581
00:37:56,503 --> 00:37:58,271
Apparently, Her Grace believed

582
00:37:58,305 --> 00:38:02,342
that you two had some sort
of special relationship.

583
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,312
We don't.
I did fuck her once.

584
00:38:05,346 --> 00:38:07,380
- I know.
- But we don't.

585
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:09,049
I know.

586
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,784
But how would the queen
get that idea?

587
00:38:10,818 --> 00:38:13,587
Why don't you ask her?

588
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:19,059
Any advice for me
on my new position?

589
00:38:19,094 --> 00:38:22,029
Keep a low profile.

590
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:25,332
If I had a gold dragon

591
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:28,435
for every time I heard
that joke, I'd be richer than you are.

592
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:30,337
Well, you are richer than I am.

593
00:38:30,372 --> 00:38:32,406
Good point.

594
00:38:32,441 --> 00:38:35,776
They're only numbers.
Numbers on paper.

595
00:38:35,811 --> 00:38:39,280
Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.

596
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:40,849
Trivial even.

597
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,651
- You want a real challenge?
- <i>( women giggling )</i>

598
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:44,086
Try whores.

599
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,689
I've tried quite a few.

600
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:49,191
Well, lots of work to do.

601
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:51,961
Enjoy the Eyrie.

602
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:53,996
Come on, I'm here later.

603
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,865
Come on.

604
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:00,937
Tonight, then.

605
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:04,974
Looks like dull reading.

606
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:07,276
Tyrion: You think all reading
is dull reading.

607
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,179
It's an opinion I share with
some of the finest men I know.

608
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:12,813
The secret history of the Seven
Kingdoms is written in these pages.

609
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:15,452
Unless Lord Twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers

610
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,053
to hide what he's really up to.

611
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,122
Unless he made it all up, yes.

612
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,558
- Podrick, do keep up.
- Yes, my lord.

613
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,860
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

614
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:27,264
After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,

615
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,199
I finally found
a suitable reward

616
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,535
for the services you've
provided over and above

617
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,137
<i>what might be</i>
<i>considered reasonable.</i>

618
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:35,573
Tell me, Pod,

619
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,376
have you ever been
with a woman?

620
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,945
- No, my lord.
- Wonderful.

621
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:46,384
Genna specializes
in first-timers.

622
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:49,153
She's not bad with
second-timers, either.

623
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:51,155
Uh, my lord...

624
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,625
A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear

625
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:55,860
through my would-be killer's face,
wouldn't you say?

626
00:39:57,964 --> 00:40:00,766
Now, as it happens,

627
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,302
Marei...

628
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:06,605
is quite the spear
handler herself.

629
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,176
She's here to thank you
for staying by my side

630
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,946
as the battle raged
all around me.

631
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,815
He's handsome.

632
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:18,152
You didn't tell me
he was handsome.

633
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:23,091
Kayla is famous
from here to Volantis

634
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,360
in certain circles.

635
00:40:25,395 --> 00:40:27,996
<i>One of four women in the world</i>

636
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:31,767
who can perform a proper
Meereenese Knot.

637
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:34,870
My lord, I don't even...

638
00:40:34,905 --> 00:40:36,639
<i>She's here to thank you</i>

639
00:40:36,673 --> 00:40:39,408
<i>for being a thoroughly</i>
<i>respectful fellow</i>

640
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:42,245
who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord."

641
00:40:45,582 --> 00:40:47,450
Be back in time for my supper.

642
00:40:51,788 --> 00:40:54,656
Pace yourself, lad.

643
00:40:54,691 --> 00:40:57,125
For years I've heard
that Littlefinger

644
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,528
is a magician.

645
00:40:59,562 --> 00:41:02,531
Whenever the crown needs money,
he rubs his hands together

646
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:05,200
and, poof, mountains of gold.

647
00:41:05,235 --> 00:41:07,636
Let me guess.
He's not a magician.

648
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:09,605
No.

649
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:14,043
- He's stealing it?
- Worse, he's borrowing it.

650
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:16,679
What's wrong with that?

651
00:41:16,713 --> 00:41:20,382
We can't afford to pay it back,
that's what's wrong with it.

652
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:22,751
The crown owes millions
to my father.

653
00:41:22,786 --> 00:41:25,120
Seeing as it's his grandson's
ass on the throne,

654
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:27,122
I imagine he'll forgive
that debt.

655
00:41:27,157 --> 00:41:29,457
Forgive a debt, my father?

656
00:41:29,492 --> 00:41:31,926
For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive.

657
00:41:31,961 --> 00:41:33,895
I've never borrowed
money before.

658
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:36,297
I'm not clear on the rules.

659
00:41:36,332 --> 00:41:37,766
Well...

660
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,001
<i>Ahem!</i>

661
00:41:42,038 --> 00:41:44,339
The basic principle is

662
00:41:44,373 --> 00:41:45,874
I lend you money,

663
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:48,444
and after an agreed upon
period of time,

664
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:51,080
you return it with interest.

665
00:41:51,114 --> 00:41:52,581
And what if I don't?

666
00:41:52,615 --> 00:41:54,683
Well, you have to.

667
00:41:54,717 --> 00:41:56,050
But what if I don't?

668
00:41:56,085 --> 00:41:58,419
This is why
I don't lend you money.

669
00:41:58,454 --> 00:42:01,956
Anyway, it's not my father
I'm worried about.

670
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,958
It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.

671
00:42:03,992 --> 00:42:05,693
We owe them tens of millions.

672
00:42:05,727 --> 00:42:10,230
If we fail to repay these loans,
the bank will fund our enemies.

673
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:13,400
One way or another,
they always get their gold back.

674
00:42:13,435 --> 00:42:15,035
<i>( door opens )</i>

675
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,972
Ah, the return
of the conquering hero.

676
00:42:18,006 --> 00:42:20,475
Does he have a little
jaunt in his step?

677
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:22,143
The lad's practically skipping.

678
00:42:22,177 --> 00:42:23,845
You were gone a long time.

679
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:25,680
I trust you got
your money's worth.

680
00:42:25,715 --> 00:42:27,348
Or should I say
my money's worth?

681
00:42:29,785 --> 00:42:32,119
Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.

682
00:42:32,154 --> 00:42:33,888
This is more than
I give you in a year.

683
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:36,891
He's a squire.
You don't pay him.

684
00:42:36,925 --> 00:42:39,426
Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.

685
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,361
They wouldn't take it, my lord.

686
00:42:42,696 --> 00:42:44,864
Maybe they're trying
to curry some favor

687
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:46,266
<i>with the new Master of Coin.</i>

688
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,401
Have you ever known a whore
to turn down gold?

689
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:50,970
They were happy enough
to take it when I gave it to them.

690
00:42:51,004 --> 00:42:52,705
What did you tell them?

691
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:54,306
I didn't tell them anything.

692
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:57,410
- What did you do to them?
- Lots of things.

693
00:42:57,444 --> 00:42:59,378
And they seemed
to like these things?

694
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:00,947
Yes, my lord.

695
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:02,682
<i>Of course</i>
<i>they seemed to like it.</i>

696
00:43:02,716 --> 00:43:04,217
They're paid
to seem to like it.

697
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:06,486
Only they weren't paid.

698
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,456
What are you saying?
These ladies enjoyed him so much,

699
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,091
they gave him
the time for free?

700
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:13,493
Is that what you're telling us?

701
00:43:18,065 --> 00:43:19,332
Sit down, Podrick.

702
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:28,373
We're going to need details.

703
00:43:28,408 --> 00:43:30,810
Copious details.

704
00:43:34,714 --> 00:43:36,916
<i>( horse whinnies )</i>

You know how we deal

( groans )

719
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,060
Take off his pants.

- ( men laughing )
- No! No!

721

No, no, no!

722

Come, my lord.

731
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:03,761
You're a long way from home
and winter is coming.

I'll take the big bitch first.

734
00:47:31,922 --> 00:47:35,291
When she's good and wet,
you lot can finish her off.

735

<i>My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.</i>

736
00:47:37,827 --> 00:47:40,162
Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me

737
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:42,865
to deliver Ser Jaime
to King's Landing.

738
00:47:42,899 --> 00:47:44,833
Catelyn Stark's
a treasonous cunt.

<i>Orders were to take</i>
<i>the Kingslayer alive.</i>

Locke: <i>Take her over there</i>
<i>where it's dark.</i>

( screaming )

749
00:48:19,202 --> 00:48:21,237
You know who she is, don't you?

750
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:27,177
A big dumb bitch
from who cares where.

751
00:48:29,747 --> 00:48:31,314
Never been with
a woman that big.

752
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:34,117
Jaime:
<i>She's Brienne of Tarth.</i>

753
00:48:34,152 --> 00:48:36,854
Her father
is Lord Selwyn Tarth.

754
00:48:36,888 --> 00:48:38,489
Heard of Tarth?

755
00:48:39,725 --> 00:48:41,358
Man:
<i>I'm gonna cut your throat!</i>

756
00:48:41,393 --> 00:48:44,394
They call it the Sapphire Isle.
Do you know why?

757
00:48:44,429 --> 00:48:47,431
Every sapphire in Westeros

758
00:48:47,465 --> 00:48:48,999
was mined on Tarth.

759
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:52,503
<i>Sapphires are gemstones.</i>

- <i>The blue ones.</i>
- I know what they are.

761
00:48:55,874 --> 00:48:59,610
Lord Selwyn would pay
his daughter's weight

762
00:48:59,644 --> 00:49:02,346
in sapphires
if she's returned to him.

<i>But only if she's alive,</i>

Man #3:
<i>Come on, on your feet.</i>

<i>Unbesmirched.</i>

Not defiled.

773
00:49:34,845 --> 00:49:37,613
Fancy word for a fancy man.

774
00:49:38,715 --> 00:49:41,350
I hated to read as a child,

775
00:49:41,384 --> 00:49:44,186
<i>but my father forced me</i>
<i>to study the books every morning</i>

<i>before I could practice</i>
<i>with sword or horse.</i>

777
00:49:47,457 --> 00:49:50,793
Two hours every day holed up in
the maester's chambers.

778
00:49:50,827 --> 00:49:54,263
I learned a lot of fancy words.

779
00:49:54,297 --> 00:49:56,499
I bet you did.

780
00:49:58,635 --> 00:50:00,870
<i>( Brienne screams )</i>

Your father,

he'd pay your weight
in gold to get you back?

783
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:14,017
You'll be a rich man

<i>And your sons will be rich men</i>

00:50:15,953 --> 00:50:18,287
<i>and their sons after them.</i>

786
00:50:18,322 --> 00:50:20,624
Lands, titles--

787
00:50:20,658 --> 00:50:22,926
you'll have them all.

788
00:50:24,595 --> 00:50:27,731
The North can't win this war.

789
00:50:27,765 --> 00:50:30,333
You're a smart man.
You understand that.

790
00:50:30,368 --> 00:50:32,068
We have the numbers.
We have the gold.

791
00:50:32,103 --> 00:50:34,171
Aye, you have both.

792
00:50:35,706 --> 00:50:38,642
Fighting bravely
for a losing cause

793
00:50:38,676 --> 00:50:40,511
is admirable.

794
00:50:40,545 --> 00:50:43,214
Fighting for a winning cause

795
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,749
is far more rewarding.

796
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:48,185
Hard to argue with that.

797
00:50:51,457 --> 00:50:54,426
Now that we're speaking
together man to man,

798
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,664
I wonder if you need
to keep me chained to this tree.

799
00:50:58,698 --> 00:51:01,100
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

800
00:51:01,134 --> 00:51:04,937
but if I could sleep
lying down,

801
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:06,773
my back would thank you for it.

802
00:51:06,807 --> 00:51:08,842
I'm not as young

803
00:51:08,876 --> 00:51:11,544
and resilient as I was once.

804
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:13,580
None of us are.

805
00:51:15,883 --> 00:51:18,085
Locke: <i>Unchain Ser Jaime</i>
<i>from the tree.</i>

806
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:20,554
Man:
<i>Come on, men.</i>

807
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:29,296
Suppose you'll be wanting
something to eat.

808
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:31,198
I'm famished, actually.

809
00:51:31,233 --> 00:51:34,335
Locke: <i>I think we've got a spare</i>
<i>partridge on the fire.</i>

810
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:37,172
Well, I do like partridge.

811
00:51:42,612 --> 00:51:46,582
Bring the bird over here
and the carving knife.

812
00:51:50,086 --> 00:51:52,521
Will this work
as a table, my lord?

813
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:54,423
Oh, yes.
Yes, this will do nic--

814
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,559
ah!

815
00:51:56,593 --> 00:51:58,761
On the stump.

816
00:52:04,434 --> 00:52:08,070
You think you're
the smartest man there is.

817
00:52:09,806 --> 00:52:13,174
That everyone alive
has to bow and scrape

818
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:15,310
and lick your boots.

819
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:17,845
- My father--
- And if you get in any trouble,

820
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:20,748
all you've got to do
is say "my father"

821
00:52:20,782 --> 00:52:23,817
and that's it,
all your troubles are gone.

822
00:52:25,419 --> 00:52:28,322
- Don't.
- Have you got something to say?

823
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,628
Careful. You don't want to say
the wrong thing.

824
00:52:38,966 --> 00:52:41,668
You're nothing
without your daddy,

825
00:52:41,702 --> 00:52:45,138
and your daddy ain't here.

826
00:52:45,172 --> 00:52:47,607
Never forget that.

827
00:52:49,177 --> 00:52:51,632
Here, this should
help you remember.

828
00:52:52,514 --> 00:52:53,991
( screaming )

829
00:52:54,111 --> 00:53:02,657
