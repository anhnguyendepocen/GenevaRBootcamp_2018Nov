1
00:00:26,882 --> 00:00:29,549
Weak men will never rule Dorne again.

2
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:33,153
Riverrun is ours.

3
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:35,189
You let the Blackfish take it from you.

4
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,291
Take that castle back.

5
00:00:37,393 --> 00:00:39,059
He'll never yield, father.

6
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:41,561
You'll remind him who
it was that got married

7
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:44,298
at the Red Wedding in the first place.

8
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:47,067
Command all the forces within the castle

9
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:49,303
to lay down their arms. Open the gates.

10
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:56,377
Your aunt Lyanna...

11
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,712
She was already promised
to Robert Baratheon.

12
00:00:58,814 --> 00:01:00,647
Father never talked about her.

13
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,350
How many tens of thousands had to die

14
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:05,119
because Rhaegar chose your aunt.

15
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:07,054
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

16
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:14,128
We need friends in Westeros,
and we need ships.

17
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,164
I hope you're right about
this expedition of yours.

18
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:20,100
If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.

19
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:23,303
Our fathers were evil men.

20
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:25,772
They left the world worse
than they found it.

21
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:28,509
We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

22
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:33,713
Your reign is over.

23
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:35,615
My reign has just begun.

24
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,292
You've made great progress.

25
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:48,495
I only pray your grandmother
follows your lead,

26
00:01:48,597 --> 00:01:50,330
or I fear for her safety.

27
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:54,801
Go home. Find comfort in
prayer and good works.

28
00:01:54,903 --> 00:01:56,636
The Mother watches over us all.

29
00:01:56,738 --> 00:01:59,173
After conferring with His
Holiness, the High Septon,

30
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:01,741
we have determined that trial by combat

31
00:02:01,843 --> 00:02:04,478
will be forbidden throughout
the Seven Kingdoms.

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,813
Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell

33
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:08,882
will stand trial before seven septons

34
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:11,051
as it was in the earliest
days of the faith.

36
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,466
Your Grace.

37
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:42,203
The trial will be
getting under way soon.

38
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,120
You got my money?

39
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:18,522
Later. Go away.

40
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:31,088
Grand Maester.

41
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,964
Ser Loras Tyrell.

42
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:18,534
Are you prepared to stand trial

43
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:22,338
and profess your guilt or
innocence before the Seven?

44
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:27,343
There'll be no need for a trial.

45
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:32,249
I confess before the Seven

46
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,350
and freely admit to my crimes.

47
00:08:35,854 --> 00:08:38,588
To which crimes will you be confessing?

48
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,024
All of them.

49
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:44,460
I lay with other men

50
00:08:44,562 --> 00:08:47,998
including the traitor Renly Baratheon.

51
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:54,271
I perjured myself before the gods.

52
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:56,673
I am guilty of depravity...

53
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:00,177
dishonesty,

54
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,744
profligacy,

55
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:04,714
and arrogance.

56
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,249
I see that now.

57
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,854
I humble myself before the Seven

58
00:09:10,956 --> 00:09:14,357
and accept whatever punishment
the gods deem just.

59
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:21,264
The gods' judgment is fierce,

60
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:23,900
but also fair.

61
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:27,370
The Warrior punishes those
who believe themselves

62
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:29,739
beyond the reach of justice.

63
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:34,311
But the Mother shows her mercy

64
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:38,215
to those who kneel before her.

65
00:09:46,258 --> 00:09:48,959
I take full responsibility
for my many sins

66
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:51,561
and unburden myself of my desires.

67
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:57,968
My only remaining wish

68
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,670
is to devote my life to the Seven.

69
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:03,840
May I be a living example of their grace

70
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:06,609
for others to witness.

71
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,647
You understand fully

72
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,583
what this means?

73
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,185
I do.

74
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:19,890
I will abandon the Tyrell name

75
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:23,026
and all that goes with it.

76
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:26,897
I will renounce my lordship
and my claims on Highgarden.

77
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:32,769
I will never marry

78
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:35,272
and I will never father children.

79
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,810
Brother Loras...

80
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:45,681
...I ask you to dedicate
your life to the seven gods.

81
00:10:49,922 --> 00:10:52,722
Will you fight to defend your faith

82
00:10:52,824 --> 00:10:55,258
against heretics and apostates?

83
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,859
I will.

84
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:27,223
No, I can't let them...

85
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:30,293
Faith is the way, Father.

86
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:54,017
All right.

87
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:56,953
I'm ready.

88
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:06,896
I have to go. I'm...

89
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:08,931
I'm late for the trial.

90
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,180
You mutilated him.

91
00:12:24,282 --> 00:12:26,182
You gave me your word.

92
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:28,651
And I have kept my word.

93
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:31,521
Once the queen mother's
trial is concluded,

94
00:12:31,623 --> 00:12:33,656
Brother Loras is free to leave.

95
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:35,658
And where is the queen mother?

96
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,029
Her litter never left the Red Keep.

97
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:43,066
It appears the queen mother doesn't
wish to attend her own trial.

98
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,138
Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.

99
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:16,766
Get the others.

100
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,743
Where's the king?

101
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:05,648
Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

102
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,383
What's the meaning of this?

103
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:09,352
I was told that...

104
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:13,123
I have more important
things to do with my time

105
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:14,591
than waste them in the presence...

106
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:17,360
Please, Grand Maester. I
bear you no ill will.

107
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,164
Please forgive me if you can.

108
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,064
This pains me, my lord.

109
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,233
Whatever your faults, you do not deserve

110
00:14:57,335 --> 00:15:00,303
to die alone in such a cold, dark place.

111
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:04,140
But sometimes before we
can usher in the new,

112
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:08,378
the old must be put to rest.

113
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:52,655
The longer you wait, the
worse it'll be for you.

114
00:16:19,618 --> 00:16:21,651
What are you doing?

115
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,086
There's something wrong.

116
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:33,656
You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.

117
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,625
The trial will begin shortly.

118
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:38,428
Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here.

119
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,862
Why do you think they're not here?

120
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:41,798
If the accused is not here,

121
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,966
she will be tried regardless.

122
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:46,302
We cannot escape the
justice of the gods...

123
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:49,038
Forget about the bloody gods and
listen to what I'm telling you!

124
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,575
Cersei understands the
consequences of her absence

125
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:54,444
and she is absent anyway,

126
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:58,414
which means she does not intend
to suffer those consequences.

127
00:17:58,516 --> 00:18:02,385
The trial can wait.
We all need to leave.

128
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:30,279
We all need to leave now!

129
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,687
Loras.

130
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,955
Stay with me.

131
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:55,204
Let me through. Let me through.

132
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:59,375
Get out of my way.

133
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:09,619
Let us through.

134
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:41,110
Confess.

135
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,247
Confess.

136
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:51,587
- No.
- Confess.

137
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:04,033
Confess. It felt good.

138
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:07,837
Beating me, starving me,

139
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:10,840
frightening me, humiliating me.

140
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:17,500
You didn't do it because you
cared about my atonement.

141
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:20,658
You did it because it felt good.

142
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:23,023
I understand.

143
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:25,454
I do things because they feel good.

144
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:31,761
I drink because it feels good.

145
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:35,965
I killed my husband because it
felt good to be rid of him.

146
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:44,273
I fuck my brother because it feels
good to feel him inside me.

147
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,442
I lie about fucking my brother...

148
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:52,481
because it feels good to keep our
son safe from hateful hypocrites.

149
00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:57,053
I killed your High Sparrow...

150
00:21:59,023 --> 00:22:01,190
and all his little sparrows...

151
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,128
all his septons, all his septas,

152
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,065
all his filthy soldiers,

153
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:12,367
because it felt good to watch them burn.

154
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:18,040
It felt good to imagine
their shock and their pain.

155
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:21,477
No thought has ever
given me greater joy.

156
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:30,686
Even confessing feels good
under the right circumstances.

157
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:38,894
You've always been quiet.

158
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:49,839
I said my face would be the last
thing you saw before you died.

159
00:22:49,941 --> 00:22:52,008
Do you remember?

160
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,076
Good.

161
00:22:56,347 --> 00:22:58,614
I'm glad to see your face.

162
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,452
I'm ready to meet the gods.

163
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:04,887
What?

164
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:08,824
Now?

165
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:10,392
Today?

166
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:15,898
You're not going to die today.

167
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:20,870
You're not going to die
for quite a while.

168
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:25,274
Ser Gregor.

169
00:23:29,313 --> 00:23:31,580
This is Ser Gregor Clegane.

170
00:23:31,683 --> 00:23:34,283
He's quiet, too.

171
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:47,029
Your gods have forsaken you.

172
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:50,399
This is your god now.

173
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:03,412
No.

174
00:24:04,515 --> 00:24:05,681
No.

175
00:24:07,218 --> 00:24:10,452
Shame.

176
00:24:10,554 --> 00:24:13,789
Shame.

177
00:24:13,891 --> 00:24:17,593
Shame.

178
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

179
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:28,303
Very sorry.

180
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,449
For House Lannister!

181
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:16,485
Hear me roar!

182
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:24,326
For House Frey!

183
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:27,496
We stand together!

184
00:25:27,598 --> 00:25:30,465
May we stand together
through the centuries,

185
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:33,035
good friends to the last.

186
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:37,173
And when we drive our swords
through our enemies' hearts,

187
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:41,076
may we speak the words of our alliance,

188
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:44,579
"The Freys and the Lannisters

189
00:25:44,682 --> 00:25:46,882
send their regards."

190
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:06,702
You don't even have to
do anything, do you?

191
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:10,372
You just sit there, a rich slab of beef,

192
00:26:10,474 --> 00:26:11,907
and all the birds come pecking.

193
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:14,409
- You're welcome to her.
- She doesn't want me.

194
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:16,912
She wants your golden
fingers up her twat.

195
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:20,883
Those two have their eyes on you.

196
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:24,953
They have their eyes on you, cunt.

197
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:26,655
Not my type.

198
00:26:26,757 --> 00:26:28,324
Not blonde enough?

199
00:26:30,794 --> 00:26:34,230
Ladies, have you met Ser
Bronn of the Blackwater,

200
00:26:34,332 --> 00:26:36,498
hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?

201
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,968
- There you go.
- Maybe I'm not in the mood.

202
00:26:42,804 --> 00:26:43,874
Fuck it.

203
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:47,042
No need to call me ser just
because I'm an anointed knight.

204
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,783
This came together rather well.

205
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,687
Your father would be pleased.

206
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:00,455
I'm sure he would be.

207
00:27:03,094 --> 00:27:05,928
Edmure is back in a cell.

208
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,664
Can't go killing my son by law.
It wouldn't be right.

209
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:11,934
Give the family a bad name.

210
00:27:15,406 --> 00:27:19,341
So the famous Blackfish
killed by foot soldiers, eh?

211
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:22,344
Legendary warrior, everyone said.

212
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:26,115
Have you done much fighting
yourself, Lord Frey?

213
00:27:26,217 --> 00:27:28,750
I'm a bit old for all that.

214
00:27:28,852 --> 00:27:31,553
No, but back in your day.

215
00:27:31,655 --> 00:27:34,589
The purpose of fighting

216
00:27:34,691 --> 00:27:37,893
is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

217
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:39,995
I've defeated mine.

218
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:43,799
Riverrun belonged to House
Tully for a thousand years.

219
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:45,467
Now it's mine.

220
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,869
What do you call that?

221
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:49,238
Victory.

222
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,840
Yes, you're a great conqueror.

223
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:57,212
Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind?

224
00:27:57,315 --> 00:28:00,049
The Tullys mocked me for years.

225
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:02,318
The Starks mocked me.

226
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,885
Where are they now?

227
00:28:03,988 --> 00:28:06,455
You talk about war as
if you're an expert,

228
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:08,857
but the one battle I
remember you fighting,

229
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,860
you were captured by Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

230
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:14,863
But it doesn't matter.

231
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:18,300
Here we are now, two kingslayers.

232
00:28:18,402 --> 00:28:22,271
We know what it's like to
have them grovel to our faces

233
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:25,374
and snigger behind our backs.

234
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:27,042
We don't mind, do we?

235
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:31,113
Fear is a marvelous thing.

236
00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:32,814
They don't fear the Freys, though.

237
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:35,650
They fear the Lannisters.

238
00:28:35,752 --> 00:28:38,120
We gave you the Riverlands
to hold the Riverlands.

239
00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:40,655
If we have to ride north
and take them back for you

240
00:28:40,757 --> 00:28:43,158
every time you lose them,

241
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,227
why do we need you?

242
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:08,583
Show me.

243
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:13,355
Your Grace, there's no need...

244
00:29:13,457 --> 00:29:14,823
Show me.

245
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:31,140
What are your thoughts
concerning the king's funeral?

246
00:29:31,242 --> 00:29:33,909
As the Sept of Baelor
is no longer an option,

247
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:37,779
perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?

248
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,384
He should be with his grandfather,

249
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:45,320
his brother, his sister.

250
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:50,426
Burn him

251
00:29:50,528 --> 00:29:53,495
and bury his ashes where
the sept once stood.

252
00:30:51,222 --> 00:30:52,588
Hello.

253
00:30:59,363 --> 00:31:03,064
From Lord Commander
Snow at Castle Black.

254
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:19,948
I'm...

255
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,550
I'm to be the new maester.

256
00:31:39,383 --> 00:31:40,536
According to our records,

257
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:42,404
Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.

258
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:45,541
He died.

259
00:31:45,643 --> 00:31:48,210
We received no report from
the maester at Castle Black.

260
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:51,446
Maester Aemon became quite ill
shortly after the election.

261
00:31:52,307 --> 00:31:53,815
He's since passed away.

262
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:56,018
Jon Snow will go to
Uploaded By GOTA-FC Team

263
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:57,952
Which is why I'm here.

264
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:03,158
This is irregular.

265
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,294
Yes, well...

266
00:32:05,295 --> 00:32:08,264
I suppose that life is irregular.

267
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:23,612
The archmaester will discuss
these irregularities with you.

268
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:29,218
In the meantime, you are
permitted to use the library.

269
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,186
Follow me.

270
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:36,157
No women or children.

271
00:34:30,407 --> 00:34:32,708
When we had feasts,

272
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,076
our family would sit up here...

273
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,980
and I'd sit down there.

274
00:34:41,318 --> 00:34:43,885
Could have been worse, Jon Snow.

275
00:34:43,987 --> 00:34:45,754
You had a family.

276
00:34:45,856 --> 00:34:47,021
You had feasts.

277
00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:52,327
Aye, you're right. I
was luckier than most.

278
00:35:07,778 --> 00:35:09,444
What is that?

279
00:35:11,081 --> 00:35:13,014
Tell him.

280
00:35:16,052 --> 00:35:18,253
Tell him who it belonged to.

281
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:24,726
The Princess Shireen.

282
00:35:24,828 --> 00:35:27,128
Tell him what you did to her.

283
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:30,598
Tell him!

284
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:38,707
We burned her at the stake.

285
00:35:51,855 --> 00:35:54,188
Why?

286
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:57,392
The army was trapped.
The horses were dying.

287
00:35:57,494 --> 00:36:00,562
- It was the only way.
- You burned a little girl alive!

288
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:02,096
I only do what my Lord commands.

289
00:36:02,198 --> 00:36:05,333
If he commands you to burn
children, your Lord is evil.

290
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,338
We are standing here because of him.

291
00:36:11,842 --> 00:36:15,109
Jon Snow is alive because
the Lord willed it.

292
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:18,814
I loved that girl like she was my own.

293
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:22,216
She was good. She was kind.
And you killed her!

294
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:25,887
So did her father.

295
00:36:28,191 --> 00:36:29,658
So did her mother.

296
00:36:31,862 --> 00:36:34,095
Her own blood knew it was the only way.

297
00:36:34,197 --> 00:36:36,798
The only way for what?

298
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,599
They all died anyway.

299
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,270
You told everyone Stannis was the one.

300
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:44,706
You had him believing
it, all of them fooled.

301
00:36:44,808 --> 00:36:47,275
- And you lied.
- I didn't lie.

302
00:36:49,012 --> 00:36:50,345
I was wrong.

303
00:36:50,447 --> 00:36:53,682
Aye, you were wrong.

304
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,418
How many died because you were wrong?

305
00:37:02,392 --> 00:37:06,294
I ask your leave to execute
this woman for murder.

306
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:08,196
She admits to the crime.

307
00:37:10,701 --> 00:37:13,101
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

308
00:37:14,972 --> 00:37:17,706
I've been ready to die for many years.

309
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,544
If the Lord was done with
me, so be it, but he's not.

310
00:37:22,646 --> 00:37:25,847
You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.

311
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:29,217
You know the great war is still to come.

312
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:32,286
You know the army of the
dead will be upon us soon.

313
00:37:33,524 --> 00:37:36,090
And you know I can
help you win that war.

314
00:37:50,373 --> 00:37:52,240
Ride south today.

315
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:55,644
If you return to the North,

316
00:37:55,746 --> 00:37:58,346
I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

317
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,700
If you ever come back this way,

318
00:38:18,802 --> 00:38:21,169
I will execute you myself.

319
00:38:53,169 --> 00:38:55,971
I'm having the lord's
chamber prepared for you.

320
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:59,741
Mother and Father's room?

321
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:03,044
You should take it.

322
00:39:04,447 --> 00:39:06,414
I'm not a Stark.

323
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:08,917
You are to me.

324
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:14,255
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

325
00:39:14,357 --> 00:39:18,259
You deserve it. We're
standing here because of you.

326
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:21,863
The battle was lost until the
Knights of the Vale rode in.

327
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:24,165
They came because of you.

328
00:39:28,171 --> 00:39:31,106
You told me Lord Baelish
sold you to the Boltons.

329
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:32,974
- He did.
- And you trust him?

330
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,711
Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.

331
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,617
I should have told you about him,

332
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,054
about the Knights of the Vale.

333
00:39:46,156 --> 00:39:47,622
I'm sorry.

334
00:39:58,935 --> 00:40:00,902
We need to trust each other.

335
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:04,005
We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.

336
00:40:04,107 --> 00:40:06,607
We have so many enemies now.

337
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:24,893
Jon.

338
00:40:24,995 --> 00:40:28,429
A raven came from the Citadel.

339
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:30,431
A white raven.

340
00:40:33,136 --> 00:40:34,669
Winter is here.

341
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,085
Well, Father always promised, didn't he?

342
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:07,335
The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,

343
00:41:07,437 --> 00:41:09,537
he was assassinated.

344
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:12,207
100 red scorpions, was it?

345
00:41:12,308 --> 00:41:14,809
You have nothing to fear
from us, Lady Olenna.

346
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:17,045
You murder your own prince,

347
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:18,880
but you expect me to trust you?

348
00:41:18,982 --> 00:41:21,950
We invited you to Dorne
because we needed your help.

349
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:24,318
You came to Dorne because
you needed our help.

350
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:27,905
What is your name again?

351
00:41:27,906 --> 00:41:29,309
Barbaro?

352
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,091
Obara.

353
00:41:30,193 --> 00:41:33,327
Obara. You look like
an angry little boy.

354
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:36,064
Don't presume to tell me what I need.

355
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:39,500
Forgive my sister. What she
lacks in diplomacy, she makes...

356
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:43,104
Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?

357
00:41:43,206 --> 00:41:45,106
No? Good.

358
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:47,608
Let the grown women speak.

359
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,412
The Lannisters have declared
war on House Tyrell.

360
00:41:51,514 --> 00:41:54,482
They have declared war on Dorne.

361
00:41:54,584 --> 00:41:58,219
We must be allies now
if we wish to survive.

362
00:41:59,522 --> 00:42:02,490
Cersei stole the future from me.

363
00:42:02,592 --> 00:42:04,358
She killed my son.

364
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,494
She killed my grandson.

365
00:42:06,596 --> 00:42:09,798
She killed my granddaughter.

366
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,733
Survival is not what I'm after now.

367
00:42:12,836 --> 00:42:15,003
You're absolutely right.

368
00:42:15,105 --> 00:42:17,672
I chose the wrong words.

369
00:42:17,774 --> 00:42:20,275
It is not survival I offer.

370
00:42:20,376 --> 00:42:22,710
It is your heart's desire.

371
00:42:24,547 --> 00:42:27,748
And what is my heart's desire?

372
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:31,552
Vengeance.

373
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:32,753
Justice.

374
00:42:36,492 --> 00:42:38,359
Fire and blood.

375
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:47,635
Your ships are nearly ready.

376
00:42:47,737 --> 00:42:50,038
I saw them painting the sails.

377
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:53,475
!T!U!S!U!B!T!I!T!U!L!O!C!O!M!

378
00:42:53,476 --> 00:42:57,278
I'm curious to see how the
Dothraki do on the poison water.

379
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,280
You're not coming with us.

380
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:04,886
New strategy?

381
00:43:04,988 --> 00:43:08,189
You want the Second Sons to
attack from the west coast?

382
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:10,892
If we take Casterly Rock,

383
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:14,562
the Lannisters will have nowhere to
run when you hit King's Landing.

384
00:43:14,664 --> 00:43:16,597
You're not going to Westeros.

385
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:19,633
You're staying here
with the Second Sons.

386
00:43:19,736 --> 00:43:22,370
There's finally peace in Meereen.

387
00:43:22,472 --> 00:43:25,806
You will keep the peace while the
people choose their own leaders.

388
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,910
Fuck Meereen.

389
00:43:29,012 --> 00:43:30,912
Fuck the people.

390
00:43:31,014 --> 00:43:33,281
I'm here for you, not them.

391
00:43:33,383 --> 00:43:35,049
You promised me.

392
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:38,086
"My sword is yours. My life is yours."

393
00:43:38,188 --> 00:43:41,289
This is what I command.

394
00:43:42,223 --> 00:43:44,392
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,

395
00:43:44,494 --> 00:43:46,995
I'll need to make alliances.

396
00:43:47,097 --> 00:43:50,464
The best way to make
alliances is with marriage.

397
00:43:53,803 --> 00:43:55,636
Who are you marrying this time?

398
00:43:55,738 --> 00:43:59,107
I don't know. Maybe no one.

399
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:02,310
But you need to lure all the
noble houses to the table?

400
00:44:02,412 --> 00:44:04,379
Are you a queen or fish bait?

401
00:44:06,816 --> 00:44:09,784
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

402
00:44:09,886 --> 00:44:12,120
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

403
00:44:12,222 --> 00:44:15,123
So that's what you want?
To be my mistress?

404
00:44:15,225 --> 00:44:18,526
I'm not proud. I don't care
what perfumed aristocrat

405
00:44:18,628 --> 00:44:20,728
sits beside you in the throne room.

406
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,864
I don't want a crown. I want you.

407
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,041
I love you.

408
00:44:33,143 --> 00:44:35,609
And I make you happy.

409
00:44:36,202 --> 00:44:37,578
You know I do.

410
00:44:39,816 --> 00:44:43,517
Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.

411
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:52,393
I can't.

412
00:45:02,138 --> 00:45:03,871
The dwarf told you to do this?

413
00:45:03,974 --> 00:45:05,639
No one tells me to do anything.

414
00:45:05,741 --> 00:45:08,909
Clever fellow. Can't
argue with his logic.

415
00:45:09,012 --> 00:45:10,744
I'm no use to you over there.

416
00:45:10,847 --> 00:45:12,113
Don't get angry.

417
00:45:12,215 --> 00:45:15,383
I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.

418
00:45:15,485 --> 00:45:17,085
Who comes after you?

419
00:45:17,187 --> 00:45:20,355
Who can ever follow Daenerys
Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

420
00:45:20,457 --> 00:45:22,723
A great number of women, I imagine.

421
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:30,764
Specific orders will be left for you

422
00:45:30,867 --> 00:45:33,801
regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

423
00:45:33,903 --> 00:45:35,703
Bay of Dragons?

424
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:38,806
We can't call it Slaver's
Bay anymore, can we?

425
00:45:41,811 --> 00:45:45,113
You'll get that throne you
want so badly, I'm sure of it.

426
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:48,649
I hope it brings you happiness.

427
00:45:53,723 --> 00:45:56,324
I pity the lords of Westeros.

428
00:45:56,426 --> 00:45:58,592
They have no idea
what's coming for them.

429
00:45:59,771 --> 00:46:02,630
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

430
00:46:21,317 --> 00:46:23,617
How did he take it?

431
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:25,786
No tears.

432
00:46:27,857 --> 00:46:30,491
I know it was hard for you.

433
00:46:30,593 --> 00:46:32,626
You turned away a man
who truly loves you

434
00:46:32,728 --> 00:46:35,629
because he would have been a
liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

435
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:41,902
That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

436
00:46:42,004 --> 00:46:44,172
if it's any consolation.

437
00:46:47,077 --> 00:46:48,876
It's not.

438
00:46:48,978 --> 00:46:51,279
No, I suppose not.

439
00:46:51,381 --> 00:46:52,913
I'm terrible at consoling.

440
00:46:53,015 --> 00:46:55,316
Yes, you really are.

441
00:46:58,488 --> 00:47:02,690
All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

442
00:47:04,194 --> 00:47:07,061
You have your armies,
you have your ships,

443
00:47:07,163 --> 00:47:09,163
you have your dragons.

444
00:47:09,265 --> 00:47:11,232
Everything you've ever wanted

445
00:47:11,334 --> 00:47:14,235
since you were old
enough to want anything,

446
00:47:14,337 --> 00:47:16,204
it's all yours for the taking.

447
00:47:17,974 --> 00:47:19,907
Are you afraid?

448
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,945
Good.

449
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:27,781
You're in the great game now.

450
00:47:27,883 --> 00:47:30,451
And the great game's terrifying.

451
00:47:30,553 --> 00:47:33,020
The only people who
aren't afraid of failure

452
00:47:33,123 --> 00:47:35,223
are madmen like your father.

453
00:47:37,327 --> 00:47:39,427
Do you know what frightens me?

454
00:47:40,896 --> 00:47:43,564
I said farewell to a man who loves me.

455
00:47:45,435 --> 00:47:49,003
A man I thought I cared for.

456
00:47:49,105 --> 00:47:51,071
And I felt nothing.

457
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:54,575
Just impatient to get on with it.

458
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,748
He wasn't the first to love you

459
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,916
and he won't be the last.

460
00:48:06,822 --> 00:48:11,725
Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

461
00:48:14,297 --> 00:48:19,100
For what it's worth, I've been a cynic
for as long as I can remember.

462
00:48:19,101 --> 00:48:21,902
Everyone's always asking
me to believe in things...

463
00:48:22,004 --> 00:48:25,739
family, gods, kings, myself.

464
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:27,675
It was often tempting

465
00:48:27,777 --> 00:48:30,110
until I saw where belief got people.

466
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:34,081
So I said no, thank you to belief.

467
00:48:34,184 --> 00:48:37,485
And yet here I am.

468
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,456
I believe in you.

469
00:48:44,394 --> 00:48:46,794
It's embarrassing, really.

470
00:48:48,864 --> 00:48:50,665
I'd swear you my sword,

471
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:53,801
but I don't actually own a sword.

472
00:48:53,903 --> 00:48:55,903
It's your counsel I need.

473
00:48:56,005 --> 00:48:58,439
It's yours.

474
00:48:58,541 --> 00:48:59,973
Now and always.

475
00:49:01,477 --> 00:49:03,311
Good.

476
00:49:04,614 --> 00:49:06,647
I...

477
00:49:06,749 --> 00:49:08,516
I had something made for you.

478
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,753
I'm not sure if it's right.

479
00:49:22,064 --> 00:49:24,765
Tyrion Lannister,

480
00:49:24,867 --> 00:49:26,767
I name you Hand of the Queen.

481
00:50:01,003 --> 00:50:03,537
You're not one of mine, are you?

482
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,139
No, my lord.

483
00:50:05,241 --> 00:50:06,907
Didn't think so.

484
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:09,243
Too pretty.

485
00:50:13,516 --> 00:50:16,317
Where are my damn moron sons?!

486
00:50:16,419 --> 00:50:20,154
Black Walder and Lothar
promised to be here by midday.

487
00:50:20,256 --> 00:50:22,089
They're here, my lord.

488
00:50:22,191 --> 00:50:25,493
Well, what are they doing,
trimming their cunt hairs?

489
00:50:25,595 --> 00:50:27,662
Tell them to come here now.

490
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:30,030
But they're already here, my lord.

491
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:37,070
Here, my lord.

492
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:57,391
They weren't easy to carve.

493
00:50:59,061 --> 00:51:00,961
Especially Black Walder.

494
00:51:02,774 --> 00:51:03,931
What...

495
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,707
My name is Arya Stark.

496
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:14,308
I want you to know that.

497
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:17,144
The last thing you're ever going to see

498
00:51:17,246 --> 00:51:19,980
is a Stark smiling down
at you as you die.

499
00:52:14,771 --> 00:52:16,771
Forgive me, my lady...

500
00:52:18,207 --> 00:52:21,208
if you're at prayer.

501
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,310
I'm done with all that.

502
00:52:25,515 --> 00:52:28,048
I came here every day when I was a girl.

503
00:52:29,752 --> 00:52:32,586
I prayed to be somewhere else.

504
00:52:32,688 --> 00:52:36,391
Back then I only thought about what I
wanted, never about what I had.

505
00:52:40,496 --> 00:52:41,929
I was a stupid girl.

506
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:43,964
You were a child.

507
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:49,737
What do you want?

508
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,205
I thought you knew what I wanted.

509
00:52:52,308 --> 00:52:53,908
I was wrong.

510
00:52:54,009 --> 00:52:56,677
No, you weren't.

511
00:52:59,415 --> 00:53:00,981
Every time I'm faced with a decision,

512
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:03,317
I close my eyes and
see the same picture.

513
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:08,422
Whenever I consider an
action, I ask myself

514
00:53:08,524 --> 00:53:12,660
will this action help to
make this picture a reality?

515
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,397
Pull it out of my mind

516
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,333
and into the world?

517
00:53:21,437 --> 00:53:24,404
And I only act if the answer is yes.

518
00:53:27,176 --> 00:53:30,203
A picture of me...

519
00:53:30,204 --> 00:53:32,945
on the Iron Throne...

520
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,450
and you by my side.

521
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:48,428
It's a pretty picture.

522
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:57,471
News of this battle will spread
quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.

523
00:53:57,573 --> 00:54:01,074
I've declared for House
Stark for all to hear.

524
00:54:01,176 --> 00:54:03,644
You've declared for other
houses before, Lord Baelish.

525
00:54:03,746 --> 00:54:06,446
It's never stopped you
from serving yourself.

526
00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:08,749
The past is gone for good.

527
00:54:08,851 --> 00:54:10,918
You can sit here mourning its departure

528
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,954
or you can prepare for the future.

529
00:54:14,056 --> 00:54:16,524
You, my love,

530
00:54:16,626 --> 00:54:19,259
are the future of House Stark.

531
00:54:19,361 --> 00:54:23,030
Who should the North rally behind?

532
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:25,833
A trueborn daughter of
Ned and Catelyn Stark

533
00:54:25,935 --> 00:54:27,835
born here at Winterfell

534
00:54:27,937 --> 00:54:31,138
or a motherless bastard
born in the south?

535
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,833
This is where I leave you.

536
00:54:59,936 --> 00:55:01,735
You're not coming with us?

537
00:55:03,205 --> 00:55:06,607
The Wall is not just ice and stone.

538
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:09,877
Ancient spells were carved
into its foundations.

539
00:55:11,681 --> 00:55:13,747
Strong magic

540
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:16,984
to protect men from what lies beyond.

541
00:55:17,086 --> 00:55:20,921
And while it stands,
the dead cannot pass.

542
00:55:21,023 --> 00:55:22,022
I cannot pass.

543
00:55:38,741 --> 00:55:40,674
Where will you go?

544
00:55:40,776 --> 00:55:42,309
The great war is coming

545
00:55:42,411 --> 00:55:45,212
and I still fight for the living.

546
00:55:47,282 --> 00:55:49,382
I'll do what I can...

547
00:55:50,753 --> 00:55:52,953
as long as I can.

548
00:55:56,859 --> 00:55:58,959
Thank you, Uncle Benjen.

549
00:55:59,061 --> 00:56:01,394
I wish you both good fortune.

550
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:43,203
Are you sure you're ready for this?

551
00:56:43,305 --> 00:56:46,406
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now.

552
00:56:46,508 --> 00:56:48,742
I have to be ready for this.

553
00:57:22,974 --> 00:57:24,978
Ned?

554
00:57:25,081 --> 00:57:27,581
Lyanna.

555
00:57:27,683 --> 00:57:29,783
Is that you?

556
00:57:33,555 --> 00:57:35,555
Is that really you?

557
00:57:40,495 --> 00:57:42,395
You're not a dream?

558
00:57:43,532 --> 00:57:45,632
No, I'm not a dream.

559
00:57:47,302 --> 00:57:49,169
I'm here.

560
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,606
Right here.

561
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:55,042
I've missed you, big brother.

562
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,380
I've missed you, too.

563
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,620
I want to be brave.

564
00:58:09,258 --> 00:58:11,759
You are.

565
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:14,594
I'm not.

566
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,566
I don't want to die.

567
00:58:19,668 --> 00:58:21,902
You're not going to die.

568
00:58:25,707 --> 00:58:27,540
Get her some water!

569
00:58:27,643 --> 00:58:29,943
- No, no water.
- Is there a maester?

570
00:58:30,045 --> 00:58:32,379
Listen to me, Ned.

571
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:36,370
_

572
00:58:38,788 --> 00:58:41,521
If Robert finds out, he'll...

573
00:58:41,623 --> 00:58:43,490
you know he will.

574
00:58:43,592 --> 00:58:45,458
You have to protect him.

575
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:50,430
Promise me, Ned.

576
00:58:52,835 --> 00:58:54,701
Promise me.

577
00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:08,816
Promise me, Ned.

578
00:59:13,289 --> 00:59:15,088
Promise me.

579
00:59:45,654 --> 00:59:48,555
You can't expect Knights of the Vale

580
00:59:48,657 --> 00:59:51,291
to side with wildling invaders.

581
00:59:51,393 --> 00:59:55,329
We didn't invade. We were invited.

582
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:57,130
Not by me.

583
00:59:57,233 --> 00:59:59,032
The free folk, the northerners,

584
00:59:59,134 --> 01:00:01,501
and the Knights of the
Vale fought bravely,

585
01:00:01,603 --> 01:00:03,904
fought together, and we won.

586
01:00:04,006 --> 01:00:08,742
My father used to say we find our
true friends on the battlefield.

587
01:00:08,844 --> 01:00:11,444
The Boltons are defeated.

588
01:00:11,546 --> 01:00:13,480
The war is over.

589
01:00:13,582 --> 01:00:15,482
Winter has come.

590
01:00:15,584 --> 01:00:19,086
If the maesters are right, it'll be
the coldest one in a thousand years.

591
01:00:19,188 --> 01:00:22,622
We should ride home and
wait out the coming storms.

592
01:00:22,724 --> 01:00:24,824
The war is not over.

593
01:00:24,927 --> 01:00:26,960
And I promise you, friend,

594
01:00:27,062 --> 01:00:29,997
the true enemy won't wait out the storm.

595
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:31,598
He brings the storm.

596
01:00:51,586 --> 01:00:55,655
Your son was butchered at the
Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,

597
01:00:55,757 --> 01:00:57,590
but you refused the call.

598
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:03,931
You swore allegiance to
House Stark, Lord Glover,

599
01:01:04,033 --> 01:01:06,633
but in their hour of greatest need,

600
01:01:06,735 --> 01:01:08,735
you refused the call.

601
01:01:10,839 --> 01:01:12,872
And you, Lord Cerwyn,

602
01:01:12,975 --> 01:01:16,843
your father was skinned
alive by Ramsay Bolton.

603
01:01:16,946 --> 01:01:19,413
Still you refused the call.

604
01:01:22,517 --> 01:01:26,386
But House Mormont remembers.

605
01:01:26,488 --> 01:01:29,189
The North remembers.

606
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:33,860
We know no king but the King in
the North whose name is Stark.

607
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,397
I don't care if he's a bastard.

608
01:01:37,499 --> 01:01:40,100
Ned Stark's blood runs
through his veins.

609
01:01:40,202 --> 01:01:44,671
He's my king from this
day until his last day.

610
01:02:01,357 --> 01:02:03,923
Lady Mormont speaks harshly

611
01:02:04,026 --> 01:02:05,325
and truly.

612
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:13,833
My son died for Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

613
01:02:13,935 --> 01:02:17,004
I didn't think we'd find
another king in my lifetime.

614
01:02:17,106 --> 01:02:19,539
I didn't commit my men to your cause

615
01:02:19,641 --> 01:02:22,275
'cause I didn't want more
Manderlys dying for nothing.

616
01:02:24,546 --> 01:02:26,013
But I was wrong.

617
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,953
Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.

618
01:02:34,693 --> 01:02:36,456
He is the White Wolf.

619
01:02:36,558 --> 01:02:39,493
The King in the North.

620
01:02:46,968 --> 01:02:49,436
I did not fight beside you on the field

621
01:02:49,538 --> 01:02:52,972
and I will regret that
until my dying day.

622
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,710
A man can only admit when he was wrong

623
01:02:57,812 --> 01:02:59,379
and ask forgiveness.

624
01:03:02,384 --> 01:03:04,684
There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

625
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:09,789
There will be more fights to come.

626
01:03:09,891 --> 01:03:13,427
House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

627
01:03:13,529 --> 01:03:15,828
as we have for a thousand years.

628
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:19,899
And I will stand behind Jon Snow...

629
01:03:22,337 --> 01:03:24,404
the King in the North!

630
01:03:26,308 --> 01:03:29,209
The King in the North!

631
01:03:29,311 --> 01:04:10,872
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

632
01:04:12,787 --> 01:04:14,787
Company halt!

633
01:04:17,792 --> 01:04:19,259
Halt!

634
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:23,263
Halt!

635
01:04:35,233 --> 01:04:36,242
Come on.

636
01:05:30,932 --> 01:05:34,701
I now proclaim Cersei
of the House Lannister

637
01:05:34,803 --> 01:05:37,437
First of Her Name,

638
01:05:37,539 --> 01:05:40,907
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

639
01:05:41,009 --> 01:05:44,211
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

640
01:06:30,058 --> 01:06:32,125
Long may she reign.

641
01:06:32,227 --> 01:06:34,394
Long may she reign.
