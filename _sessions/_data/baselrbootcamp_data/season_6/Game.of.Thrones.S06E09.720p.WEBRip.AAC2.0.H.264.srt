00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:14,713
<i>and you don't</i>
<i>have Winterfell.</i>

164
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:18,450
<i>Why lead those poor souls</i>
<i>into slaughter?</i>

165
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:21,253
There's no need
for a battle.

166
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:24,289
Get off your horse
and kneel.

167
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:27,993
I'm a man of mercy.

168
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:34,700
You're right.

169
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:36,935
There's no need
for a battle.

170
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,106
Thousands of men
don't need to die.

171
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:44,810
Only one of us.

172
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:49,181
Let's end this
the old way.

173
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:51,350
You against me.

174
00:14:57,591 --> 00:15:00,626
( chuckling )

175
00:15:03,364 --> 00:15:06,632
I keep hearing stories
about you, bastard.

176
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,867
The way people
in the North talk
about you,

177
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:11,236
you're the greatest
swordsman who ever walked.

178
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,740
Maybe you are that good.

179
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:16,942
Maybe not.

180
00:15:17,044 --> 00:15:19,578
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I'd beat you.</i>

181
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,848
But I know that my army
will beat yours.

182
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,050
<i>I have 6,000 men.</i>

183
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:28,520
You have, what,
half that?

184
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:30,022
Not even?

185
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:32,157
Aye, you have
the numbers.

186
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:35,094
Will your men
want to fight for you

187
00:15:35,196 --> 00:15:38,097
when they hear you
wouldn't fight for them?

188
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:48,774
He's good.
Very good.

189
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:52,811
Tell me, will you let
your little brother die

190
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:55,114
because you're too proud
to surrender?

191
00:15:55,216 --> 00:15:57,182
How do we know
you have him?

192
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,276
<i>Now, if you want</i>
<i>to save--</i>

193
00:16:24,378 --> 00:16:26,945
You're going to die
tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

194
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:31,950
Sleep well.

195
00:16:40,194 --> 00:16:43,061
She's a fine woman,
your sister.

196
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:46,231
<i>I look forward to having</i>
<i>her back in my bed.</i>

197
00:16:49,703 --> 00:16:52,171
And you're all
fine-looking men.

198
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:54,406
My dogs are desperate
to meet you.

199
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:56,141
I haven't fed them
for seven days.

200
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:57,576
They're ravenous.

201
00:16:57,678 --> 00:17:00,679
I wonder which parts
they'll try first.

202
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:03,182
<i>Your eyes?</i>

203
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:04,750
Your balls?

204
00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:09,354
We'll find out
soon enough.

205
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:13,792
In the morning,
then, bastard.

206
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:32,978
Jon:
<i>If he was smart,</i>
<i>he'd stay inside</i>

207
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,847
<i>the walls of Winterfell</i>
<i>and wait us out.</i>

208
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:37,883
That's not his way.
He knows the North
is watching.

209
00:17:37,985 --> 00:17:40,819
If the other houses
sense weakness on his part,

210
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,654
they'll stop fearing him.

211
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:45,424
He can't have that.
Fear is his power.

212
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:48,093
It's his weakness, too.
His men don't want
to fight for him.

213
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:50,796
They're forced to fight
for him. If they feel
the tide turning...

214
00:17:50,898 --> 00:17:53,232
It's not his men
that worry me.

215
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:54,666
It's his horses.

216
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:56,935
I know what mounted
knights can do to us.

217
00:17:57,037 --> 00:18:00,138
You and Stannis cut through us
like piss through snow.

218
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:02,474
We're digging trenches
all along our flanks.

219
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:04,810
They won't be able
to hit us the way that
Stannis hit you,

220
00:18:04,912 --> 00:18:06,211
in a double envelopment.

221
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:12,084
A pincer move.

222
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:19,491
They won't be able
to hit us from the sides.

223
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:21,493
Good.

224
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:26,732
It's crucial that
we let them charge at us.

225
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:30,736
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

226
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:36,575
If we let him buckle
our center, he'll pursue.

227
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:40,178
Then we'll have him
surrounded on three sides.

228
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:44,049
Did you really
think that cunt would
fight you man-to-man?

229
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:46,685
No.

230
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:48,687
But I wanted
to make him angry.

231
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:53,725
I want him coming
at us full tilt.

232
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:57,462
We should all
get some sleep.

233
00:18:57,564 --> 00:19:01,400
Tormund:
<i>Rest, Jon Snow.</i>
<i>We need you sharp tomorrow.</i>

234
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:14,212
So you've met the enemy,

235
00:19:14,315 --> 00:19:17,716
drawn up
your battle plans.

236
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:20,752
Aye, for what
they're worth.

237
00:19:20,854 --> 00:19:24,723
You've known
him for the space
of a single conversation,

238
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:26,625
you and your
trusted advisors,

239
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:28,293
<i>and you sit around</i>
<i>making your plans</i>

240
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:31,263
<i>on how to defeat</i>
<i>a man you don't know.</i>

241
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:32,898
<i>I lived with him.</i>

242
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,599
I know the way
his mind works.

243
00:19:34,702 --> 00:19:37,803
I know how he likes
to hurt people.

244
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:42,140
Did it ever once
occur to you that I might
have some insight?

245
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:46,244
You're right.

246
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:49,014
You think he's going
to fall into your trap.

247
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:51,383
He won't.
He's the one
who lays traps.

248
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:54,286
-<i> He's overconfident.</i>
- He plays with people.

249
00:19:54,388 --> 00:19:57,022
He's far better at it
than you. He's been doing
it all his life.

250
00:19:57,124 --> 00:19:59,925
Aye, and what have I
been doing all my life?
Playing with broomsticks?

251
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:03,829
I fought beyond
the Wall against worse
than Ramsay Bolton.

252
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:06,698
I've defended the Wall
from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

253
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,334
You don't know him.

254
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:12,571
All right, tell me.

255
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:15,507
What should we do?
How do we get Rickon back?

256
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:19,211
We'll never get him back.

257
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:23,648
Rickon is Ned Stark's
trueborn son,

258
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:25,450
which makes him
a greater threat to Ramsay

259
00:20:25,552 --> 00:20:28,620
than you, a bastard,
or me, a girl.

260
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:31,690
As long as he lives,
Ramsay's claim to Winterfell
will be contested,

261
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:35,260
which means
he won't live long.

262
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:37,729
We can't give up
on our brother.

263
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:40,932
Listen to me, please.
He wants you to make
a mistake.

264
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:44,069
Of course he does.
What should I do
differently?

265
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:46,271
I don't know.
I don't know anything
about battles.

266
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:49,741
Just don't do
what he wants you to do.

267
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:51,076
Aye, that's good advice.

268
00:20:51,178 --> 00:20:52,544
You think that's obvious?

269
00:20:52,646 --> 00:20:54,012
Well, it is
a bit obvious.

270
00:20:54,114 --> 00:20:55,380
If you had asked
for my advice earlier,

271
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:57,149
I would have told you
not to attack Winterfell

272
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:59,551
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

273
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:01,953
When will we have
a larger force?

274
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:04,089
We've pleaded with every
house that'll have us.

275
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:05,457
The Blackfish
can't help us.

276
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,492
We're lucky to have
this many men.

277
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:11,096
- It's not enough.
- No, it's not enough.
It's what we have.

278
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:19,438
Battles have been won
against greater odds.

279
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:27,679
If Ramsay wins,

280
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:29,681
I'm not going
back there alive.

281
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:31,450
Do you understand me?

282
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:37,956
I won't let ever
let him touch you again.

283
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:42,961
I'll protect you,
I promise.

284
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:46,698
No one can protect me.

285
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,700
No one
can protect anyone.

286
00:22:00,514 --> 00:22:02,414
( sighs )

287
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:09,454
Davos:
<i>You think there's hope?</i>

288
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:11,890
Tormund:
I've never seen
these Bolton fuckers fight.

289
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:14,326
And they've never seen
the free folk fight,

290
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:16,428
so, yes, there's hope.

291
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,134
You want to avenge
your king, don't you?

292
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:25,070
It wasn't the Boltons
defeated Stannis.

293
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:27,639
It was Stannis himself.

294
00:22:27,741 --> 00:22:29,407
I loved the man.

295
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,910
He lifted me up
and made me something.

296
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:35,147
But he had demons
in his skull whispering
foul things.

297
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:37,849
- You saw these demons?
- What?

298
00:22:39,052 --> 00:22:41,319
No, it's a manner
of speaking.

299
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:46,124
Not actual demons.

300
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:47,559
Oh.

301
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:50,595
Well, you loved
that cunt Stannis

302
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:52,831
and I loved
the man he burned.

303
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:54,966
Mance didn't have
demons in his skull.

304
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:58,570
He didn't torch people
or listen to some red witch.

305
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:01,039
I believed in him.

306
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:05,076
I thought he was
the man to lead us
through the Long Night.

307
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:07,445
But I was wrong
just like you.

308
00:23:09,383 --> 00:23:12,517
Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

309
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:16,655
Jon Snow's not a king.

310
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:20,192
No, he's not.

311
00:23:23,263 --> 00:23:27,332
<i>I need a good drink</i>
<i>to help me sleep the night</i>
<i>before a fight.</i>

312
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:28,900
You want some?

313
00:23:29,002 --> 00:23:31,403
I have a jug
of sour goat's milk

314
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:33,438
stronger than any
of that grape water

315
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,707
you southern twats
like sucking on.

316
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:37,642
No, thanks.
It does sound delicious,

317
00:23:37,744 --> 00:23:40,345
but I better keep
a clear head.

318
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:42,781
I can never sleep
the night before a battle.

319
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:44,549
So what do you do
all night?

320
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:46,851
I walk.

321
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:48,687
Think and walk.

322
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:50,922
Think and walk
until I'm far enough
away from camp

323
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:53,124
that no one can hear me
shitting my guts out.

324
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:55,160
( laughs )

325
00:23:55,262 --> 00:23:57,195
Happy shitting.

326
00:24:10,477 --> 00:24:11,543
My lady.

327
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:18,450
You weren't at
the war council.

328
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:21,886
I'm not a soldier.

329
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,323
Any advice?

330
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:27,726
Don't lose.

331
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:35,600
If I do, if I fall...

332
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:40,639
don't bring me back.

333
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:42,674
I'll have to try.

334
00:24:42,776 --> 00:24:44,876
I'm ordering you
not to bring me back.

335
00:24:44,978 --> 00:24:46,645
I am not your servant,
Jon Snow.

336
00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:49,014
You're in my camp.
I'm the commander.

337
00:24:49,116 --> 00:24:51,783
I serve the Lord of Light.

338
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:54,152
I do what he commands.

339
00:24:54,254 --> 00:24:55,654
How do you know
what he commands?

340
00:24:57,157 --> 00:25:00,392
I interpret his signs

341
00:25:00,494 --> 00:25:02,661
as well as I can.

342
00:25:05,232 --> 00:25:07,565
If the Lord didn't
want me to bring you back,

343
00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:10,235
how did I bring you back?

344
00:25:10,337 --> 00:25:12,871
I have no power.

345
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:16,341
Only what he gives me
and he gave me you.

346
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:19,978
Why?

347
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,247
I don't know.

348
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:31,356
Maybe you're only needed
for this small part of his
plan and nothing else.

349
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:34,459
Maybe he brought you here
to die again.

350
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:41,700
What kind of god would do
something like that?

351
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,770
The one we've got.

352
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,698
<i>( horn blowing )</i>

353
00:27:35,582 --> 00:27:38,783
Last time we saw each other
was at Winterfell, yes?

354
00:27:41,822 --> 00:27:45,123
You were making
jokes about my height,
I seem to recall.

355
00:27:47,427 --> 00:27:49,461
Everyone who makes a joke
about a dwarf's height

356
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:53,398
thinks he's the only person
ever to make a joke about
a dwarf's height.

357
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,801
"The height of nobility,"
"a man of your stature,"

358
00:27:56,903 --> 00:27:58,736
"someone to look up to."

359
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:02,140
You're all making the same
five or six jokes.

360
00:28:02,242 --> 00:28:05,510
- It was a long time ago.
- It was.

361
00:28:05,612 --> 00:28:08,880
And how have things been
going for you since then?

362
00:28:08,982 --> 00:28:11,783
Not so well, I gather.

363
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:14,419
Can't imagine you would
have murdered the Stark boys

364
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:15,720
if things had
been going well.

365
00:28:15,822 --> 00:28:17,422
I didn't murder
the Stark boys.

366
00:28:17,524 --> 00:28:20,391
But I did things
that were just as bad
or worse.

367
00:28:20,494 --> 00:28:21,693
And he paid for them.

368
00:28:21,795 --> 00:28:23,761
Doesn't seem like it.

369
00:28:23,864 --> 00:28:25,697
He's still alive.

370
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,765
It was complicated
for you, I'm sure,

371
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:30,034
growing up at Winterfell.

372
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:33,304
Never quite knowing
who you were.

373
00:28:33,406 --> 00:28:36,975
But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

374
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:39,010
You've brought us 100 ships
from the Iron Fleet

375
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:40,745
<i>with men to sail them.</i>

376
00:28:40,847 --> 00:28:43,047
In return, I expect
you want me to support

377
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:45,583
your claim to the throne
of the Iron Islands?

378
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:47,585
Not my claim.
Hers.

379
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:49,687
And what's wrong with you?

380
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:51,289
I'm not fit to rule.

381
00:28:51,391 --> 00:28:52,957
We can agree
upon that at least.

382
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:55,660
Has the Iron Islands
ever had a queen before?

383
00:28:55,762 --> 00:28:57,328
No more than Westeros.

384
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:02,467
Our Uncle Euron returned home
after a long absence.

385
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:06,037
He murdered our father
and took the Salt Throne
from Yara.

386
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:08,706
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

387
00:29:10,176 --> 00:29:13,244
Lord Tyrion
tells me your father
was a terrible king.

388
00:29:13,346 --> 00:29:15,480
You and I
have that in common.

389
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,249
We do.

390
00:29:18,351 --> 00:29:20,685
And both murdered
by a usurper as well.

391
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:23,588
Will their ships
be enough?

392
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,758
With the former Masters'
fleet, possibly.

393
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,893
Barely.

394
00:29:28,995 --> 00:29:31,663
There are more
than 100 ships
in the Iron Fleet.

395
00:29:31,765 --> 00:29:34,165
There are and Euron
is building more.

396
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:35,900
He's going to offer
them to you.

397
00:29:36,002 --> 00:29:37,435
So why shouldn't
I wait for him?

398
00:29:37,537 --> 00:29:40,071
The Iron Fleet
isn't all he's bringing.

399
00:29:40,173 --> 00:29:42,273
He also wants
to give you--

400
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:46,010
His big cock,
I think he said.

401
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,347
<i>Euron's offer</i>
<i>is also an offer</i>
<i>of marriage, you see.</i>

402
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:51,249
<i>You won't get one</i>
<i>without the other.</i>

403
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:53,851
And I imagine
your offer is free
of any marriage demands?

404
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:57,255
I never demand,
but I'm up for
anything, really.

405
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:01,759
Theon:
<i>He murdered our father</i>
<i>and would have murdered us.</i>

406
00:30:01,861 --> 00:30:04,429
<i>He'll murder you as soon</i>
<i>as you have what he wants.</i>

407
00:30:04,531 --> 00:30:06,197
The Seven Kingdoms.

408
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:07,465
All of them.

409
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:09,267
And you don't want
the Seven Kingdoms?

410
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:12,637
Your ancestors defeated ours
and took the Iron Islands.

411
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:15,206
We ask you
to give them back.

412
00:30:15,308 --> 00:30:16,574
And that's all?

413
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:19,243
We'd like you to help us
murder an uncle or two

414
00:30:19,346 --> 00:30:21,212
who don't think
a woman's fit to rule.

415
00:30:21,314 --> 00:30:22,947
Reasonable.

416
00:30:25,251 --> 00:30:27,852
What if everyone starts
demanding their independence?

417
00:30:27,954 --> 00:30:29,954
She's not demanding,
she's asking.

418
00:30:30,056 --> 00:30:32,824
The others are free
to ask as well.

419
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,064
Our fathers were evil men,
all of us here.

420
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:42,600
They left the world
worse than they found it.

421
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:44,302
<i>We're not going</i>
<i>to do that.</i>

422
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:47,405
We're going to leave
the world better than
we found it.

423
00:30:49,442 --> 00:30:52,944
You will support
my claim as queen
of the Seven Kingdoms

424
00:30:53,046 --> 00:30:56,347
and respect the integrity
of the Seven Kingdoms.

425
00:30:56,449 --> 00:31:00,985
No more reaving, roving,
raiding, or raping.

426
00:31:02,322 --> 00:31:03,788
That's our way of life.

427
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,423
No more.

428
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:14,699
No more.

429
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:46,164
( horses nickering )

430
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:01,859
Do you like games,
little man?

431
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:04,028
Let's play a game.

432
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,367
Run to your brother.

433
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:11,302
The sooner
you make it to him,

434
00:35:11,404 --> 00:35:13,771
the sooner you get
to see him again.

435
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:17,909
That's it.

436
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:20,144
That's the game.

437
00:35:20,246 --> 00:35:22,146
Easy.

438
00:35:22,248 --> 00:35:24,148
Ready?

439
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,516
Go.

440
00:35:29,522 --> 00:35:32,490
No, you have to run,
remember?

441
00:35:32,592 --> 00:35:34,725
Those are the rules.

442
00:35:47,206 --> 00:35:49,607
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

443
00:36:08,561 --> 00:36:09,794

444
00:36:15,368 --> 00:36:17,068
Hyah! Hyah!

00:37:00,947 --> 00:37:03,447

( gasps )

448
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:34,745
Don't.

449
00:37:45,525 --> 00:37:46,857
Prepare to charge.

450
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:50,327
Prepare to charge.

00:38:05,912 --> 00:38:08,279
Go! Go!
Follow your commander!

456

( men shouting )

457
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,219
Run and fight!

458
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:17,621

459
00:38:42,348 --> 00:38:43,280

464
00:38:59,732 --> 00:39:00,965
Now.

00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:05,402
Karstark:
<i>Cavalry, charge!</i>

466
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:10,407
