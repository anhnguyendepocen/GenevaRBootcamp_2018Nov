My mother

you Westerosi
were a grim lot.

Grim, bearded,

stinking barbarians

45
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:44,930

Did you ever think
you'd marry one?

I never thought
I'd marry anyone at all.

Never?

50

- My queen.
- Lord Bolton.

55
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:19,133
Let me guess which one
is the good news.

56
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,538
Word from Riverrun

57
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:25,206
and Winterfell.

58
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:32,613
( crying ) I hadn't seen
him in years.

59
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:36,783
I don't even know
how many.

60
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:40,153
We'll travel
to the funeral together.

<i>Lord Bolton</i>
<i>will garrison here</i>

62

<i>until we return.</i>

63
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:48,795
Will I be wearing manacles
when I lay my father to rest?

64
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:56,703
Something else?

65

By the time Bolton's
bastard got to Winterfell,

66
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:02,275
the ironborn were gone.

67
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:07,179
<i>They massacred everyone</i>
<i>and put the castle to the torch.</i>

68
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:12,551
And Bran and Rickon
have not been found.

69
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:18,592
They may have escaped.

70
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:21,929
Or Theon may have taken them
back to the Iron Islands as hostages.

71
00:06:21,963 --> 00:06:24,364
Have you received
any demands?

72
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,734
No.

73
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:29,369
Have you heard anything
from Theon at all?

74
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:35,509

75

76
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:53,194
Where am I?

77
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:01,169
Who are you?

78
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:08,610
What do you want?

79
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,779
I want to do this.

80
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:13,281
( screaming )

81
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:17,919
Do you know how long
it's going to take us

82
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:20,655
to get to King's Landing walking
through fields and forests?

83
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,357
Yes.

84
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:23,892
<i>( sheep bleating )</i>

85
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:25,260
So how shall
we pass the time?

86
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:27,162
By putting one foot
in front of the other.

87
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,531
It's going to be
a very dull walk.

88
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:30,932
I'm here to take you
to King's Landing

89
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,802
and bring back
Lady Stark's daughters in exchange.

90
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:35,837
Dull is fine.

91
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,639
You know, it doesn't matter
how loyal a servant you are,

92
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:41,542
no one enjoys the company
of a humorless mute.

93
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:43,010
Trust me on this.

94
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:45,279
People have been serving me
since I was born.

95
00:07:45,313 --> 00:07:48,683
You think Lady Stark is going
to want a giant towheaded plank

96
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:51,286
following her around
for the rest of her life?

97
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,690
A week's journey with you and she'll
order you to fall on your sword.

98
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:58,427
If Lady Stark is unhappy
with any aspect of my service,

99
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:00,196
I'm sure
she'll let me know.

100
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,730
She's an honest woman.

101
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:03,732
All the good
it's done her.

102
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,138
( moans )

103
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:12,508
How did you come into
Lady Stark's service?

104
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:13,875
There's something
we can talk about.

105
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,810
Not your concern,
Kingslayer.

106
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:17,412
It had to be recently.

107
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:19,414
You weren't with her
at Winterfell.

108
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:20,848
How would you know?

109
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:23,685
Because I visited
Winterfell.

110
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:25,453
I would have noticed
your dour head

111
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,422
smacking into
the archways.

112
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:28,957
Move.

113
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,065
- Were you pledged to Stannis?
- Gods, no.

114
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,000
Ah, Renly.

115
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:40,602
Really?

116
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,337
He wasn't fit
to rule over anything

117
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:44,205
more important than
a 12-course meal.

118
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:45,807
- Shut your mouth.
- Why?

119
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:49,110
I lived with him at court since
he was a boy, don't forget.

120
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:51,245
Could hardly escape
the little tulip.

121
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,281
Skipping down the corridors
in his embroidered silks.

122
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:56,150
I knew him
far better than you.

123
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:58,152
I knew him
as well as anyone.

124
00:08:58,187 --> 00:08:59,721
As a member
of his Kingsguard,

125
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:01,523
he trusted me
with everything.

126
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:02,957
He would have been
a wonderful king.

127
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:04,459
Sounds like you
quite fancied him.

128
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:06,728
I did not
fancy him.

129
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:08,397
Oh, gods, you did.

130
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:11,266
<i>Did you ever tell him?</i>

131
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,102
No, of course not.

132
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,105
You weren't Renly's
type, I'm afraid.

133
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,976
He preferred curly-haired
little girls like Loras Tyrell.

134
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,377
You're far too much
man for him.

135
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:24,212
I'm not interested
in foul rumors.

136
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:26,248
Unless they're
about me.

137
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:28,617
It's all true
about Renly.

138
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:31,554
His proclivities were the
worst kept secret at court.

139
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:33,923
It's a shame the throne
isn't made out of cocks.

140
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:36,859
- They'd have never got him off it.
- Shut your mouth!

141
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:40,430
I don't blame him.

142
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:42,465
And I don't
blame you, either.

143
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,702
We don't get to choose
who we love.

144
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:48,505
<i>( horse snorts )</i>

145
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:59,716
- Where are you headed, then?
- Jaime: South.

146
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:01,785
- You?
- Riverrun.

147
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:04,955
Staying off
the kingsroad, are you?

148
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,158
They get you no matter
where you go.

149
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:08,827
- You can't win.
- No, you really can't.

150
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:11,062
Looks like you're
safe enough, though.

151
00:10:11,097 --> 00:10:12,731
Meaning no offense,
my lady, but...

152
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:15,166
( laughs ) I wouldn't tangle
with you.

153
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:17,035
( laughs )

154
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:19,237
- Seven blessings to you.
- And you.

155
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:28,346
Jaime:
<i>He knows who I am.</i>

156
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,814
- He doesn't.
- Maybe you're right.

157
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:32,583
But what if you're not?
What if he tells someone?

158
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:37,489
We're not doing it.

159
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:39,758
<i>He's an innocent man.</i>

160
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:42,327
More innocent than
Lady Stark's daughters?

161
00:10:53,972 --> 00:10:56,140
Make it tighter here.

162
00:10:57,242 --> 00:10:58,842
That's better.

163
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,878
<i>It makes you look</i>
<i>very strong.</i>

164
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:03,914
No flowers.

165
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:06,049
I said no flowers.

166
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:09,552
All these are wrong.
Bring others.

167
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,554
Yes, Your Grace.

168
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:14,524
Bloody flowers.

169
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:16,558
On the king.

170
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,961
Looks like
a Tyrell rose.

171
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:21,830
Give it to Margaery
for her wedding gown.

172
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:24,399
Should be more
than enough fabric.

173
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:31,306
Tell me what
you think of her.

174
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,541
Who?

175
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:34,610
Margaery.

176
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:36,545
She's an ideal match.

177
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:38,514
With the Tyrells beside us,

178
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:40,750
we'll crush the Northerners.

179
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,953
Hang their lords,
burn their strongholds,

180
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:45,521
sow their fields
with salt,

181
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:48,657
and no one will think of
rebelling for another century.

182
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:53,295
It is a good match, but
what do you think of her?

183
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:59,368
She's beautiful
and intelligent.

184
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:01,170
Yes, she is.

185
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:04,974
Her concern with the well-being of
the common people is interesting.

186
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,510
Not to me.

187
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:09,045
( chuckles )

188
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,481
I only meant that to go out of
your way to endanger yourself--

189
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:13,817
This is becoming
one of the most boring

190
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:16,286
conversations
I've ever had.

191
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:23,527
Margaery Tyrell dotes
on filthy urchins for a reason.

192
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:26,995
She dresses like
a harlot for a reason.

193
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,329
She married a traitor
and known degenerate

194
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:30,684
like Renly Baratheon
for a reason.

195
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:34,267
She married Renly Baratheon
because she was told to.

196
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:36,969
That's what
intelligent women do--

197
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,838
what they're told.

198
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:45,643
- You need to ask yourself--
- I don't need to do anything.

199
00:12:55,753 --> 00:12:57,153
( sighs )

200
00:12:57,187 --> 00:12:58,954
Better.

201
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,156
Much better.

202
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:04,525
I still
don't believe it.

203
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,293
He didn't.
He didn't want anything.

204
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,996
He just takes an interest
because he loved my mother.

205
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,967
Men only want one thing
from a pretty girl.

206
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:20,137
Littlefinger's not
in love with me.

207
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:24,707
Love is not
the thing he wants.

208
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:28,143
He's too old.

209
00:13:28,177 --> 00:13:30,345
They never see it
that way.

210
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:37,184
He didn't ask you
to do something for him?

211
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:39,419
Spy on someone or...?

212
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:41,322
No.

213
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:49,663
If he does ask you
for anything

214
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:51,665
or try anything

215
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:55,035
or touch you,
I want you to tell me.

216
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:58,706
Why?
What will you do?

217
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,374
I will make him stop.

218
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:02,777
<i>( knocks )</i>

219
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:04,512
Guard:
<i>Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.</i>

220
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:07,014
Send him in.

221
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:17,692
Lady Sansa.

222
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,093
Ser Loras.

223
00:14:19,128 --> 00:14:20,395
My sister Margaery
invites you to take

224
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:21,830
the air with her
and our grandmother

225
00:14:21,864 --> 00:14:24,232
the Lady Olenna
in the gardens.

226
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,968
May I escort you
to them?

227
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:36,477
I believe you grow more beautiful
every day, Lady Sansa.

228
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:38,679
You are too kind,
Ser Loras.

229
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:44,652
You probably don't remember
the first time we met.

230
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:49,057
At the Hand's tourney,
you gave me your favor.

231
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:52,994
A rose,
a red rose.

232
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,696
Of course I did.

233
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,167
Margaery:
<i>It's more your color.</i>

234
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:01,937
- You take it.
- Thank you.

235
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:03,839
You're such a dear.

236
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:05,908
I'll take my leave.

237
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:07,710
Lady Sansa.

238
00:15:07,744 --> 00:15:09,913
Thank you,
Ser Loras.

239
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:11,915
Come.

240
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,357
Lady Sansa,
it is my honor

241
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:22,559
to present
my grandmother...

242
00:15:23,728 --> 00:15:26,096
the Lady Olenna
of House Tyrell.

243
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:28,132
Kiss me, child.

244
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,201
It's so good of you
to visit me

245
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:32,103
and my foolish
flock of hens.

246
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:34,506
We're very sorry
for your losses.

247
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,209
And I was sorry when I heard of
Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.

248
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:40,445
- He was very gallant.
- Gallant, yes.

249
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:42,714
And charming
and very clean.

250
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:44,649
He knew how
to dress and smile

251
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:47,519
and somehow this gave him the
notion he was fit to be king.

252
00:15:47,553 --> 00:15:49,554
Renly was brave
and gentle, Grandmother.

253
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:51,256
Father liked him
and so did Loras.

254
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,925
Loras is young
and very good

255
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,894
at knocking men
off horses with a stick.

256
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:57,596
That does not
make him wise.

257
00:15:57,631 --> 00:15:58,998
As to your
fathead father--

258
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:01,834
Grandmother!
What will Sansa think of us?

259
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:04,269
<i>She might think we have</i>
<i>some wits about us.</i>

260
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:06,004
One of us,
at any rate.

261
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:08,774
It was treason.
I warned them.

262
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,744
Robert has two sons and
Renly has an older brother.

263
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:13,879
How could he possibly
have any claim

264
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:16,515
to that ugly
iron chair?

265
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:19,585
We should have stayed well out
of all this if you ask me.

266
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:21,487
But once
the cow's been milked,

267
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,090
there's no squirting
the cream back up her udders.

268
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:26,160
So here we are
to see things through.

269
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,797
What do you say
to that, Sansa?

270
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:31,867
Shall we have
some lemon cakes?

271
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:33,468
Lemon cake's my favorite.

272
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:35,637
So we've been told.

273
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:39,174
Are you going to bring the food or
do you mean to starve us to death?

274
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:42,010
Here, Sansa,

275
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,146
come sit with me.

276
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,616
I'm much less boring
than these others.

277
00:16:49,786 --> 00:16:52,388
Do you know my son?

278
00:16:52,422 --> 00:16:54,256
The Lord of Highgarden?

279
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,492
I haven't had
the pleasure.

280
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,494
No great pleasure,
believe me.

281
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:00,029
A ponderous oaf.

282
00:17:00,063 --> 00:17:02,064
<i>His father</i>
<i>was an oaf as well.</i>

283
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:04,867
<i>My husband,</i>
<i>the late Lord Luthor.</i>

284
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:07,803
He managed to ride off
a cliff whilst hawking.

285
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:10,006
They say he was looking
up at the sky

286
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,543
and paying no mind to where
his horse was taking him.

287
00:17:13,577 --> 00:17:15,578
And now my son
is doing the same,

288
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:19,282
only this time he's riding
a lion instead of a horse.

289
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:21,885
Now...

290
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:24,288
I want you
to tell me the truth

291
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:28,259
about this royal boy,
this Joffrey.

292
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:30,461
I... I...

293
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:31,930
You, you.

294
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:33,698
Who else
would know better?

295
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:36,535
We've heard
some troubling tales.

296
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:39,304
Is there any truth
to them?

297
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,740
<i>Has this boy</i>
<i>mistreated you?</i>

298
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:44,109
Has he ripped out
your tongue?

299
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:46,578
Joff-- King Joffrey,

300
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:49,848
he-- His Grace
is very fair

301
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:52,951
and handsome
and as brave as a lion.

302
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:55,587
Yes, all Lannisters
are lions.

303
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:59,324
And when a Tyrell farts,
it smells like a rose.

304
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:01,626
<i>But how kind is he?</i>
<i>How clever?</i>

305
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,162
Has he a good heart,
a gentle hand?

306
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:05,630
I'm to be his wife.

307
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:07,865
I only want to know
what that means.

308
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,068
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

309
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,208
Bring me some cheese.

310
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:19,610
The cheese will be served
after the cakes, my lady.

311
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,945
The cheese will be served
when I want it served.

312
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,547
And I want it served now.

313
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:29,753
Are you frightened, child?

314
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:31,688
No need for that.

315
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:33,623
We're only women here.

316
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:36,960
Tell us the truth.
No harm will come to you.

317
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:40,997
My father always
told the truth.

318
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:43,099
Yes, he had
that reputation.

319
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:45,568
And they named him traitor
and took his head.

320
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:48,505
Joffrey.

321
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,440
Joffrey did that.

322
00:18:50,475 --> 00:18:53,844
He promised he would be merciful
and he cut my father's head off.

323
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:55,679
And he said
that was mercy.

324
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:59,549
Then he took me up on the
walls and made me look at it.

325
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:05,589
Go on.

326
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:09,726
I-- I can't.
I never meant--

327
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,962
my father was a traitor.

328
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:14,431
My brother as well.
I have traitor's blood.

329
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:16,133
Please don't make me
say anymore.

330
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,667
She's terrified,
Grandmother.

331
00:19:17,702 --> 00:19:21,138
- Just look at her.
- Speak freely, child.

332
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:24,975
We would never betray
your confidence, I swear it.

333
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:29,846
He's a monster.

334
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:32,849
Ah.

335
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:34,818
<i>That's a pity.</i>

336
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:37,254
Please, don't stop
the wedding.

337
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:39,956
Have no fear.
The Lord Oaf of Highgarden

338
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,825
<i>is determined that</i>
<i>Margaery shall be queen.</i>

339
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,329
Even so, we thank you
for the truth.

340
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:49,165
Ah, here comes my cheese.

341
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:02,379
( panting )

342
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,382
Karstark:
<i>We're at war.</i>

343
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,952
<i>This march</i>
<i>is a distraction.</i>

344
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:12,155
My grandfather's funeral
is not a distraction.

345
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:15,158
- Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
- No.

346
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:17,226
Then it's a distraction.

347
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:20,329
My Uncle Edmure has his
forces garrisoned there.

348
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:22,231
We need his men.

349
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:24,567
Unless he's been
breeding them,

350
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:26,569
he don't have enough
to make a difference.

351
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:29,205
Have you lost faith
in our cause?

352
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:32,842
If it's revenge,
I still got faith in it.

353
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:34,743
If you no longer
believe--

354
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:37,412
I can believe
till it snows in Dorne.

355
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:41,050
Don't change the fact
that we've got half the men.

356
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:45,454
You don't think
we can win?

357
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:47,623
May I speak my mind,
Your Grace?

358
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:51,126
Have you not been speaking
your mind, Lord Karstark?

359
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,062
I think you lost this war

360
00:20:54,097 --> 00:20:56,265
the day you married her.

361
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:04,007
<i>( horse whinnies )</i>

362
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:07,711
Whoa, whoa.

363
00:21:09,514 --> 00:21:10,814
Your Grace.

364
00:21:10,848 --> 00:21:13,450
You're afraid of her.

365
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:16,187
- And she knows it.
- I'm not afraid of her.

366
00:21:18,022 --> 00:21:20,356
( snorting )

367
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,398
May I help you,
Lady Stark?

368
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:30,067
No.

369
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:32,603
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have--

370
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:34,138
You can't help
because a mother

371
00:21:34,172 --> 00:21:37,342
makes one for her
children to protect them.

372
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:41,279
Only a mother
can make them.

373
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:50,220
You've made them
before?

374
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:53,923
Twice.

375
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,092
Did they work?

376
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:00,263
After a fashion.

377
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:06,536
I prayed for my son Bran
to survive his fall.

378
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:12,242
Many years before that,

379
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:14,778
one of the boys came down
with the pox.

380
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:18,983
Maester Luwin said if he made it
through the night, he'd live.

381
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:22,820
But it would be
a very long night.

382
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:28,760
So I sat with him
all through the darkness.

383
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:33,298
Listened to his ragged
little breaths,

384
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:36,168
his coughing,
his whimpering.

385
00:22:36,202 --> 00:22:38,303
<i>Which boy?</i>

386
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:41,473
Jon Snow.

387
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,111
When my husband brought
that baby home from the war,

388
00:22:46,146 --> 00:22:48,614
I couldn't bear
to look at him.

389
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:51,083
I didn't want
to see those brown

390
00:22:51,118 --> 00:22:54,387
<i>stranger's eyes</i>
<i>staring up at me.</i>

391
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:57,358
<i>So I prayed to the gods,</i>
<i>take him away.</i>

392
00:22:57,392 --> 00:22:59,893
Make him die.

393
00:23:02,063 --> 00:23:03,863
He got the pox.

394
00:23:06,534 --> 00:23:10,938
<i>And I knew I was the worst</i>
<i>woman who ever lived.</i>

395
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,975
A murderer.

396
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:19,246
I'd condemned this poor,
innocent child

397
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,715
to a horrible death

398
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:24,284
all because I was
jealous of his mother.

399
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,721
A woman he didn't
even know.

400
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:30,925
So I prayed
to all seven gods,

401
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:34,128
let the boy live.

402
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,597
Let him live

403
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:38,665
and I'll love him.

404
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,002
I'll be a mother to him.

405
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:45,773
I'll beg my husband
to give him a true name,

406
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:48,743
to call him Stark
and be done with it,

407
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:50,345
to make him one of us.

408
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:52,647
And he lived.

409
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,483
And he lived.

410
00:23:57,386 --> 00:23:59,821
And I couldn't keep
my promise.

411
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,895
<i>And everything</i>
<i>that's happened since then...</i>

412
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,700
<i>all this horror</i>
<i>that's come to my family...</i>

413
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:17,973
it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.

414
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:31,254
Was it hard for you
to kill the Halfhand?

415
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:35,025
Yes.

416
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:37,494
You liked him?

417
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:40,196
I like you, but if
you're playing us false,

418
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:42,165
it won't be hard
for me to kill you.

419
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,934
I've got wildling
blood in my veins.

420
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:47,037
- These are my people.
- I understand.

421
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:49,973
Well, how could
you understand?

422
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:52,275
You want to protect
your people.

423
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,478
Do you know what it takes
to unite 90 clans,

424
00:24:55,513 --> 00:24:57,781
half of whom want
to massacre the other half

425
00:24:57,815 --> 00:25:00,217
for one insult or another?

426
00:25:00,251 --> 00:25:04,021
They speak seven different
languages in my army.

427
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:06,023
<i>The Thenns hate</i>
<i>the Hornfoots.</i>

428
00:25:06,057 --> 00:25:07,958
<i>The Hornfoots hate</i>
<i>the ice-river clans.</i>

429
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:10,594
Everyone hates
the cave people.

430
00:25:10,628 --> 00:25:13,997
So you know how I got
moon worshippers

431
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:16,166
and cannibals and giants

432
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:18,469
to march together
in the same army?

433
00:25:18,503 --> 00:25:19,870
No.

434
00:25:19,904 --> 00:25:22,740
I told them we were
all going to die

435
00:25:22,774 --> 00:25:24,742
if we don't get south.

436
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:26,911
Because that's the truth.

437
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,591
Shouldn't be long now.

438
00:25:42,994 --> 00:25:45,429
( screeching )

439
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,972
What's wrong with him?

440
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:56,107
Mance:
<i>He's a warg.</i>

441
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:59,211
He can enter the mind of
animals, see through their eyes.

442
00:25:59,245 --> 00:26:00,745
He's scouting for us.

443
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:03,448
What, you've never
met a warg?

444
00:26:08,987 --> 00:26:11,455
( screeching )

445
00:26:13,124 --> 00:26:14,625
Mance:
<i>Orell.</i>

446
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:17,060
( shivers )

447
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:27,037
Where were you
this time?

448
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:34,311
The Fist
of the First Men.

449
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:36,748
What did you see?

450
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,385
( chuckles )

451
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:43,287
Dead crows.

452
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:49,994
( men coughing )

453
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:54,064
Rast:
What's the matter, Piggy?

454
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:56,066
You crying
'cause you're cold?

455
00:26:58,971 --> 00:27:02,707
There's 200 brothers
killed by dead men

456
00:27:02,741 --> 00:27:05,242
and you're still here

457
00:27:05,277 --> 00:27:07,812
whimpering.

458
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:10,047
That seem fair to you?

459
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:13,184
I seen 'em torn
to pieces fighting

460
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:15,919
while you was off somewhere
hiding in a hole.

461
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:19,923
Why don't you lie down
and rest for a while, eh?

462
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:23,594
You know you want to.

463
00:27:40,443 --> 00:27:42,343
Hey.

464
00:27:47,616 --> 00:27:49,350
Get up, Sam.

465
00:27:49,385 --> 00:27:52,020
- No.
- <i>Get up.</i>

466
00:27:52,054 --> 00:27:53,621
I can't.

467
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:56,190
If you stop,
you'll die.

468
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:59,926
'Course if you don't stop,
you'll probably die, too.

469
00:27:59,994 --> 00:28:03,229
- You don't care.
- 'Course we care.

470
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,532
You left me.

471
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:08,968
When the white walkers came,
you left me.

472
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:11,638
Aye, we left you.

473
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:14,007
<i>You're fat and you're slow.</i>

474
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,243
We didn't want to die.

475
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,811
<i>( Sam sobbing )</i>

476
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:19,847
Help me get him up.

477
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:22,649
Looks like that piggy
is done for.

478
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:24,818
- Help us get him up.
- He's slowing us down.

479
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:26,453
Just get him up!

480
00:28:26,488 --> 00:28:29,556
Why? So the rest
of us can die?

481
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:33,360
We'll move faster
without him.

482
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:36,830
What is this?
Get up, Tarly.

483
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,768
- Is he all right?
- Aye, I think so.

484
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,569
If he can't, we may as
well just go without him.

485
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:44,471
That's enough.

486
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:46,540
Tarly,

487
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,908
I forbid you to die.

488
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:51,178
Do you hear me?

489
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:53,913
- Why should the rest of us--
- Rast...

490
00:28:53,948 --> 00:28:56,416
you're responsible
for him.

491
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,484
What am I
supposed to do?

492
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,553
Make sure he gets
back alive.

493
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:03,355
If he doesn't,
you don't.

494
00:29:04,257 --> 00:29:06,258
Move on!

495
00:29:12,065 --> 00:29:14,433
I'm not dying
for you, Piggy.

496
00:29:14,468 --> 00:29:16,302
You hear me?

497
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:39,526
- <i>( branch snaps )</i>
- <i>( wolf growling )</i>

498
00:29:41,596 --> 00:29:43,564
Where's Rickon
and Hodor?

499
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:46,901
Looking for food.

500
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:48,703
( growling )

501
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:51,539
What's out there?

502
00:30:06,756 --> 00:30:10,592
( growling )

503
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:40,722
( growling )

504
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,191
Osha:
<i>Not another step, boy.</i>

505
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:45,361
<i>Unless you want to drown</i>
<i>in your own blood.</i>

506
00:30:45,395 --> 00:30:46,762
I'm unarmed.

507
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,631
That was poor planning.

508
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:51,867
My sister carries
the weapons.

509
00:30:53,503 --> 00:30:56,405
I'm better with them.

510
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,774
<i>Drop the spear.</i>

511
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,378
<i>Drop it.</i>

512
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:07,849
If you kill me,

513
00:31:07,883 --> 00:31:10,519
that wolf will tear
you to bits.

514
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:16,058
( growling )

515
00:31:16,092 --> 00:31:18,995
You must be Summer.

516
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,201

517
00:31:41,953 --> 00:31:44,322
I'm Jojen Reed.

518
00:31:44,356 --> 00:31:47,425
This is my sister Meera.

519
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:54,132
We've come a long way
to find you, Brandon.

520
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:58,071
And we have
much farther to go.

521
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:03,410
Gendry: I'm just trying
to understand.

522
00:32:03,444 --> 00:32:06,279
Arya: Would you please
shut up about it?

523
00:32:06,314 --> 00:32:08,014
Jaqen H'ghar offered
you three kills.

524
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:10,249
- I'm not listening.
- But just explain it to me.

525
00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:12,986
He offered to kill
any three people you wanted.

526
00:32:13,053 --> 00:32:15,722
Dead. All you had to do
was give him the names.

527
00:32:15,756 --> 00:32:18,458
Anyone.
You could have picked King Joffrey.

528
00:32:18,492 --> 00:32:20,526
- Shut up.
- You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

529
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:22,028
Jaqen got us
out of Harrenhal,

530
00:32:22,062 --> 00:32:23,796
so why are you
complaining?

531
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:25,632
But you could have
ended the war.

532
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:28,401
- Where are we going?
- North.

533
00:32:28,435 --> 00:32:29,836
If we were going north,

534
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,504
we should have come
to the Red Fork River by now.

535
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:33,673
Maybe we already
passed it.

536
00:32:33,707 --> 00:32:35,341
It's 100 feet wide.

537
00:32:35,376 --> 00:32:37,609
How could we have
passed it?

538
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:40,078
If we hit the Red Fork,

539
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:41,580
we can follow it west
to Riverrun.

540
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:43,115
My mother grew up there.

541
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,484
My grandfather's a lord.
He'll protect us.

00:34:01,463 --> 00:34:04,299
I like dangerous people.

Why are your friends

568
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:12,174
What friends?

569
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:15,445
The fat one to your left
and the lad beside him.

570
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:38,335
Three young ones
on the run

carrying
castle-forged swords.

572
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:43,373
You escape
from Harrenhal?

573
00:34:43,408 --> 00:34:46,009
- Arya: <i>Who are you?</i>
- Thoros of Myr.

574
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:48,078
And the fellow here
with the bow is Anguy.

575
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:49,513
No, who do you
fight for?

576
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,582
<i>The Brotherhood</i>
<i>without Banners.</i>

577
00:34:53,852 --> 00:34:56,153
Now come along.

578
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:57,788
I want to hear
how two boys

579
00:34:57,823 --> 00:35:01,359
and a very dangerous girl
escaped Harrenhal.

580
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:04,062
I'm not going with them.
The Brotherhood?

581
00:35:04,096 --> 00:35:06,632
That's who the Mountain
and them lot were looking for.

582
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:08,467
They'll bring us back
and put rats in us.

583
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:10,501
You've got nothing
to fear from us, son.

584
00:35:10,536 --> 00:35:13,337
The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.

585
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,272
We're trying to save it.

586
00:35:15,307 --> 00:35:16,908
Now come on.

587
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:19,643
We'll talk some more
over brown bread and stew.

588
00:35:19,677 --> 00:35:21,778
And then you can go
on your way.

589
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,422
Here's the thing, fat boy.

590
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:36,261
When I'm done talking,

591
00:35:36,295 --> 00:35:39,198
that arrow's falling down
on your fat head.

592
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:42,600
So I advise you move,
because I'm done talking.

593
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:51,376
( men laughing )

594
00:35:57,682 --> 00:36:00,950
Half the country's starving
and look at this one.

595
00:36:00,985 --> 00:36:03,453
Maybe he's the reason
half the country's starving.

596
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:15,332
My lion.

597
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:19,069
We've spoken of this.

598
00:36:19,104 --> 00:36:21,805
You cannot come here.

599
00:36:24,676 --> 00:36:27,578
But you said I should come
to you with any problems.

600
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:29,413
Did anyone see you?

601
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:31,615
- No.
- You sure?

602
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,951
My father does not
make idle threats.

603
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:37,322
Having you killed would be
the high point of his week.

604
00:36:37,356 --> 00:36:39,358
You have to be
absolutely certain.

605
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:45,064
All right.

606
00:36:45,098 --> 00:36:47,099
What is this problem?

607
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:50,969
I'm worried about Sansa.

608
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:52,837
When she spoke
with Lord Baelish,

609
00:36:52,872 --> 00:36:56,308
his friend warned me
about him.

610
00:36:56,342 --> 00:36:58,443
Baelish doesn't
have friends.

611
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:01,213
I don't know her name.

612
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:04,382
- Oh, Ros? The redhead?
- How do you know her?

613
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:06,618
I try to know
as many people as I can.

614
00:37:06,652 --> 00:37:08,420
You never know
which one you'll need.

615
00:37:08,454 --> 00:37:10,188
She's a whore.

616
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:13,324
Yes, well, we shouldn't be
judgmental about these things.

617
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,661
- You fucked her.
- Oh, please.

618
00:37:16,696 --> 00:37:19,431
All right, yes,
I fucked her once.

619
00:37:21,734 --> 00:37:23,067
Twice.

620
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:27,171
But since I met you,
my lady,

621
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:29,673
I've been with
no one else.

622
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:34,812
And was she good?
Did you like her?

623
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:36,547
Not as much
as I like you, obviously,

624
00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:39,350
or she'd be the one
torturing me right now.

625
00:37:42,454 --> 00:37:45,056
What did she say
about Littlefinger?

626
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:49,360
That Sansa
shouldn't trust him.

627
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:52,297
Is there an idiot
in any village

628
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:54,299
who trusts Littlefinger?

629
00:37:56,802 --> 00:37:58,636
We have to protect her.

630
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,871
We can't.

631
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:02,840
Now that the Lannisters
have discarded her,

632
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,276
Sansa will have
many suitors.

633
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,546
A great beauty
with a very old name.

634
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,716
A great beauty?
Oh, a great beauty?

635
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,819
Yes, she is,
objectively, very.

636
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:17,388
Her face
is quite pleasing--

637
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:19,090
to other men
and to women,

638
00:38:19,124 --> 00:38:20,992
people in general.

639
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:22,961
But not to me,
of course.

640
00:38:22,995 --> 00:38:26,164
I only have eyes
for you.

641
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:28,833
You pervert.
You want her?

642
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:32,036
- This child?
- I don't even want to talk about her.

643
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:34,806
- But you are.
- Only because you're making me.

644
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,342
( chuckles ) I didn't force you
to open your mouth

645
00:38:38,377 --> 00:38:40,411
and make words come out.

646
00:38:40,446 --> 00:38:43,648
This is cruel and unfair.
Cruelly unfair.

647
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:45,416
"Oh, the cruelty.

648
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:47,886
Shae is so cruel to me."

649
00:38:50,055 --> 00:38:52,023
Hmm, yes.

650
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:03,301
Now do you think
I'm cruel?

651
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:06,103
Only if you stop.

652
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,943
But you mustn't
come here again.

653
00:39:13,713 --> 00:39:15,948
Do you hear me?

654
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,919
You've come to
a dangerous place

655
00:39:19,953 --> 00:39:22,488
full of dangerous people.

656
00:39:24,691 --> 00:39:27,693
Dangerous people.
( moans )

657
00:39:37,304 --> 00:39:39,004
- <i>( knocks )</i>
- Guard: <i>Lady Tyrell, my king.</i>

658
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,906
Send her in.

659
00:39:55,556 --> 00:39:57,957
You wanted to see me,
Your Grace?

660
00:39:57,992 --> 00:39:59,726
I'm leaving
on a hunting trip.

661
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,128
I just wanted
to make sure

662
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:04,030
you had everything
you need before I left.

663
00:40:04,064 --> 00:40:06,299
That's very thoughtful,
Your Grace.

664
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:08,101
I have everything
I could want.

665
00:40:08,135 --> 00:40:09,336
Good. Good.

666
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,072
How are you finding life
in the capital?

667
00:40:12,106 --> 00:40:14,774
It must be quite a change
after Renly's camp.

668
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,676
A welcome one.

669
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:21,047
A military encampment
is no place for a lady.

670
00:40:21,082 --> 00:40:23,483
And the bedside
of a traitor?

671
00:40:25,953 --> 00:40:28,554
Is that a place
for a lady?

672
00:40:29,423 --> 00:40:32,525
Your Grace,

673
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,495
I tried to do my duty
as a wife, that is all.

674
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:39,098
What was your duty to this
traitor as you saw it?

675
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:41,334
The duty of any wife
to any husband--

676
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:43,068
to provide him
with children.

677
00:40:43,103 --> 00:40:45,170
<i>You failed to do this.</i>

678
00:40:45,205 --> 00:40:48,407
- Why?
- <i>I--</i>

679
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,411
I would not speak ill
of the dead, Your Grace.

680
00:40:53,445 --> 00:40:55,379
You think one ought
to speak kindly

681
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:58,216
of a traitor merely because he's
had a sword put through his heart?

682
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,084
No.

683
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,954
I do beg your pardon.

684
00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:06,257
The subtleties of politics
are often lost on me.

685
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:08,693
Renly...

686
00:41:10,462 --> 00:41:13,197
I don't believe
he was interested

687
00:41:13,232 --> 00:41:15,633
<i>in the company</i>
<i>of women.</i>

688
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:19,103
What makes you say this?

689
00:41:20,506 --> 00:41:24,376
Whenever I wanted
to make a child with him,

690
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,845
he--

691
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,914
he had so many
excuses,

692
00:41:28,948 --> 00:41:31,083
so many late-night
war councils.

693
00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:33,452
He never wanted
to try.

694
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:37,589
Except one evening,

695
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:40,425
after he'd had far too
much wine to drink,

696
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,928
he suggested something--

697
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:49,968
something that sounded
very painful

698
00:41:50,035 --> 00:41:52,103
and couldn't possibly
result in children.

699
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,040
Maybe the fault
was with me.

700
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:59,110
No, he was a known...

701
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:00,712
degenerate.

702
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:04,181
It's such a relief to hear
you say so, Your Grace.

703
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:05,916
Mmm.

704
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,652
I've considered
making his perversion

705
00:42:08,686 --> 00:42:10,687
punishable by death.

706
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:14,857
As is your right.

707
00:42:14,892 --> 00:42:18,461
You must do whatever
you need to do.

708
00:42:22,298 --> 00:42:23,699
You are the king.

709
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:25,935
Yes.

710
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:30,373
I am.

711
00:42:36,514 --> 00:42:37,981
Do you like it?

712
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:39,916
I just had it made.

713
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:42,719
Probably one of the finest
weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.

714
00:42:42,753 --> 00:42:44,154
It's beautiful.

715
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:46,389
Will you show me
how it works?

716
00:42:50,628 --> 00:42:52,162
It's a new design.

717
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:54,631
Much easier to load.
There's no crank.

718
00:42:54,665 --> 00:42:58,635
You use this lever
to draw the string.

719
00:43:04,074 --> 00:43:06,243
The bolt goes here.

720
00:43:08,612 --> 00:43:12,282
And then you just aim...

721
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:16,620
and...

722
00:43:17,755 --> 00:43:20,357
( laughs )

723
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:24,127
Would you take me
hunting sometime?

724
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:26,095
Forgive me, Your Grace.

725
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,264
I know a hunt
is no place for a woman.

726
00:43:28,298 --> 00:43:29,866
It's not unheard of.

727
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,202
My father would never
let me before--

728
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:34,637
You no longer
belong to him.

729
00:43:35,672 --> 00:43:37,607
Do you want
to hold it?

730
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:39,709
May I?
Please.

731
00:43:47,352 --> 00:43:49,687
I imagine it must be
so exciting

732
00:43:49,721 --> 00:43:51,722
to squeeze
your finger here

733
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:54,425
and watch something
die over there.

734
00:43:58,463 --> 00:44:00,964
Could you do it?

735
00:44:00,998 --> 00:44:02,999
Could you...

736
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:05,335
kill something?

737
00:44:06,804 --> 00:44:09,005
I don't know, Your Grace.
Do you think I could?

738
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,374
Yes.

739
00:44:11,409 --> 00:44:13,810
Would you like
to watch me?

740
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:19,750
Yes.

741
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:24,021
( screams )
Stop! Stop!

742
00:44:24,055 --> 00:44:26,424
- <i>Tell us the truth.</i>
- About what?

743
00:44:27,893 --> 00:44:30,395
( screams ) I don't
know what you want.

744
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:32,663
I want the truth.

745
00:44:32,698 --> 00:44:34,465
What truth?

746
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,467
Why'd you take
Winterfell?

747
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:38,903
I took it to--
I took it--

748
00:44:38,937 --> 00:44:40,338
- Who gave the orders?
- No one.

749
00:44:40,372 --> 00:44:41,906
- I took it on my own.
- <i>Why?</i>

750
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,941
To take the North
while it was vulnerable.

751
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:45,710
What were you going
to do once you took it?

752
00:44:45,744 --> 00:44:47,478
Hold it.
Rule it.

753
00:44:47,512 --> 00:44:51,215
Good.
That's very good.

754
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:56,153
( screams )

755
00:44:56,187 --> 00:44:57,888
Why did you do that?
I told you.

756
00:44:57,923 --> 00:44:59,557
Why did you take
Winterfell?

757
00:44:59,591 --> 00:45:02,859
I took it to bring glory
to my house and my father.

758
00:45:10,635 --> 00:45:12,636
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

759
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:16,106
I took it because
I hated the Starks.

760
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:18,509
I hated them
for holding me prisoner.

761
00:45:18,543 --> 00:45:20,978
I wanted to hurt them.

762
00:45:26,784 --> 00:45:28,852
What are you doing?

763
00:45:31,889 --> 00:45:34,024
Please.

764
00:45:35,092 --> 00:45:37,527
( screaming )

765
00:45:39,097 --> 00:45:41,931
I'll tell you anything.

766
00:45:41,966 --> 00:45:43,967
Just take it off.

767
00:45:44,001 --> 00:45:47,103
<i>Please.</i>
<i>Please, just take it off.</i>

768
00:45:47,138 --> 00:45:49,906
<i>( door closes )</i>

769
00:45:56,246 --> 00:45:59,415
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?

770
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:04,721
( whimpers )

771
00:46:06,524 --> 00:46:09,026
I'll come for you tonight
when the castle sleeps.

772
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,095
No, don't go.
Please, please.

773
00:46:11,129 --> 00:46:12,797
No, please
don't leave me.

774
00:46:12,831 --> 00:46:14,532
Please, please.

775
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:15,967
Please,
please don't go!

776
00:46:16,001 --> 00:46:20,706
( sobbing ) Please. Please.
Don't leave me.

777
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,408
Please don't go.

778
00:46:28,147 --> 00:46:30,281
Rickon,
stay with us.

779
00:46:31,616 --> 00:46:35,052
It's all right.
The wolves will protect him.

780
00:46:44,396 --> 00:46:46,331
You can get
inside his head,

781
00:46:46,365 --> 00:46:48,466
see through his eyes.

782
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,867
Only when I'm asleep.

783
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:52,437
That's how it begins until
you learn to control it.

784
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:53,838
You're a warg.

785
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:56,574
It's not just wolves.

786
00:46:56,609 --> 00:46:58,409
Sometimes in my dreams
there's a--

787
00:46:58,444 --> 00:47:01,179
- A three-eyed raven?
- <i>You've seen it?</i>

788
00:47:01,213 --> 00:47:03,448
We saw him together.
You haven't forgotten?

789
00:47:03,482 --> 00:47:06,184
Does it have anything
to do with warging?

790
00:47:06,218 --> 00:47:08,953
No, the raven
is something different,

791
00:47:08,987 --> 00:47:11,322
something deeper.

792
00:47:11,356 --> 00:47:12,823
The raven brings
the sight.

793
00:47:12,857 --> 00:47:15,826
Seeing things
that haven't happened yet?

794
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,095
<i>Or things that happened</i>
<i>long before you were born</i>

795
00:47:18,129 --> 00:47:21,832
or things that are happening right
now thousands of miles away.

796
00:47:21,867 --> 00:47:24,201
What's he telling him?

797
00:47:24,236 --> 00:47:26,437
Why don't you ask?

798
00:47:27,972 --> 00:47:29,907
Isn't he ashamed,
your brother,

799
00:47:29,941 --> 00:47:31,642
needing you
to protect him?

800
00:47:32,777 --> 00:47:34,444
Where's the shame in that?

801
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:38,081
Any boy his age who needs
his sister to protect him

802
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:41,951
is gonna find himself
needing lots of protecting.

803
00:47:43,187 --> 00:47:46,389
Some people
will always need help.

804
00:47:46,423 --> 00:47:48,758
<i>That doesn't mean</i>
<i>they're not worth helping.</i>

805
00:47:53,097 --> 00:47:56,433
When my father died,
I dreamt it.

806
00:47:56,467 --> 00:47:59,803
You didn't dream it.
You saw it.

807
00:47:59,871 --> 00:48:01,772
So did I.

808
00:48:01,806 --> 00:48:03,407
You have the sight, too?

809
00:48:06,411 --> 00:48:10,547
When I told my father
about your father...

810
00:48:11,983 --> 00:48:15,118
for the first time
in my life, I saw him cry.

811
00:48:15,152 --> 00:48:16,853
Your father
is Howland Reed?

812
00:48:16,887 --> 00:48:18,587
Yeah.

813
00:48:18,622 --> 00:48:21,891
He saved my father's life
during the rebellion.

814
00:48:21,925 --> 00:48:23,726
Your father told you
about the rebellion?

815
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,761
Mine never did.

816
00:48:25,796 --> 00:48:27,630
But I saw that, too.

817
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:30,866
What else have you seen?

818
00:48:30,901 --> 00:48:32,868
Only one thing
that matters--

819
00:48:32,903 --> 00:48:35,004
you.

820
00:48:44,014 --> 00:48:45,882
<i>( men laughing )</i>

821
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:47,717
Thoros: <i>I never liked</i>
<i>the skinny ones.</i>

822
00:48:47,752 --> 00:48:49,619
<i>Like drinking</i>
<i>from a puddle.</i>

823
00:48:49,654 --> 00:48:51,455
Not that I'm averse
to drinking from a puddle

824
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:52,790
every now and again,
you understand.

825
00:48:52,824 --> 00:48:54,825
I don't drink ale.

826
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,562
There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.

827
00:48:57,596 --> 00:48:59,330
- Yeah!
- You see?

828
00:48:59,365 --> 00:49:01,600
They've all suffered through
my bouts of sobriety.

829
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:03,935
It's very tedious
for all concerned.

830
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:06,437
Now, how did
three children--

831
00:49:06,472 --> 00:49:08,006
We're not children.

832
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,775
How did three young persons
such as yourselves,

833
00:49:10,809 --> 00:49:13,378
untrained
in the art of war,

834
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:15,047
escape from Harrenhal?

835
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:19,384
Gendry's a smith.

836
00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:21,086
He was apprenticed
in the armory.

837
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,423
A smith, eh?
Where'd you train?

838
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,396
King's Landing.
Tobho Mott's shop.

839
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:32,565
That criminal.
He charges twice as much

840
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,066
as every other armorer
in the city.

841
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:35,735
That's because
he's twice as good.

842
00:49:35,802 --> 00:49:39,138
Aha! A smith
and a salesman.

843
00:49:39,173 --> 00:49:41,407
Gendry stole us weapons.

844
00:49:41,442 --> 00:49:44,277
Ah, fought your way
out of Harrenhal, I see.

845
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:47,847
He knows how to use a
sword and so do I.

846
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:49,282
( men laugh )

847
00:49:49,316 --> 00:49:51,384
My brothers taught me.

848
00:49:51,418 --> 00:49:53,086
( men laugh )

849
00:49:54,855 --> 00:49:58,024
Men:
Ooh!

850
00:50:03,163 --> 00:50:06,165
( men cheer )

851
00:50:12,439 --> 00:50:15,742
- To your brothers!
- ( cheering )

852
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:24,617
You can finish
your meals before you go.

853
00:50:24,652 --> 00:50:27,086
It may be awhile
before you see another.

854
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:30,156
- You'll free us?
- I gave you my word.

855
00:50:32,892 --> 00:50:34,660
But before you go,

856
00:50:34,694 --> 00:50:37,962
allow me to raise
a cup to your--

857
00:50:37,997 --> 00:50:40,565
- Hey, hey.
- ( men cheering )

858
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:43,301
Now that is an uncommonly
large person.

859
00:50:43,336 --> 00:50:44,870
How does one
manage to subdue

860
00:50:44,904 --> 00:50:46,671
such an uncommonly
large person?

861
00:50:46,705 --> 00:50:49,407
One waits for him to drink
until he passes out.

862
00:50:49,442 --> 00:50:52,243
Poor man.
You have my sympathy.

863
00:50:54,213 --> 00:50:57,548
Aha, not a man at all.

864
00:50:58,684 --> 00:51:01,652
- A Hound!
- ( men howl and bark )

865
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,288
So good to see
you again, Clegane.

866
00:51:04,323 --> 00:51:06,290
Thoros?

867
00:51:06,325 --> 00:51:08,726
The fuck you doing here?

868
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,661
Drinking and talking
too much.

869
00:51:10,696 --> 00:51:12,697
- Same as ever.
- ( men laugh )

870
00:51:12,731 --> 00:51:16,234
- A pretty prize, lads.
- Men: Yeah!

871
00:51:18,137 --> 00:51:19,905
Girl.

872
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:23,442
What in seven hells

873
00:51:23,476 --> 00:51:25,945
are you doing
with the Stark bitch?

874
00:51:36,991 --> 00:51:39,560
Jaime:
It's a tough decision--

875
00:51:39,594 --> 00:51:41,595
take the bridge
and risk being seen

876
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,531
or cross the great water.

877
00:51:43,565 --> 00:51:46,133
- Silence, Kingslayer.
- Anyone can see us on the bridge,

878
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:49,170
but cross by water
and the current could take us

879
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:51,171
or I could escape
down the river.

880
00:51:51,206 --> 00:51:53,073
Good luck.

881
00:51:55,043 --> 00:51:59,079
It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.

882
00:51:59,114 --> 00:52:01,248
Which will she choose?

883
00:52:06,155 --> 00:52:08,122
Gambler at heart.

884
00:52:08,157 --> 00:52:09,591
Wouldn't have guessed.

885
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:11,760
Be quick about it.

886
00:52:16,165 --> 00:52:18,834
( Jaime groans )

887
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,269
- I need to rest.
- Get up.

888
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,738
I have these, you know, on your
feet when you walk too far.

889
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:23,939
- What do you call them?
- Get up now.

890
00:52:23,973 --> 00:52:26,475
Corns.
I never used to get corns.

891
00:52:26,509 --> 00:52:28,843
<i>Of course I used</i>
<i>to ride everywhere,</i>

892
00:52:28,878 --> 00:52:31,346
not march around
like a common foot soldier

893
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,614
wearing the same shit boots
for over a year.

894
00:52:33,649 --> 00:52:36,050
This heel is ruined.
There's no way--

895
00:52:36,084 --> 00:52:38,686
( grunts )

896
00:52:42,323 --> 00:52:44,124
( chuckles )

897
00:52:44,158 --> 00:52:47,795
I never understood why some knights
felt the need to carry two swords.

898
00:52:49,764 --> 00:52:51,866
( sighs )

899
00:53:02,578 --> 00:53:04,879
Ooh.

900
00:53:08,249 --> 00:53:10,651
You move well...

901
00:53:13,354 --> 00:53:15,655
for a great beast
of a woman.

902
00:53:19,592 --> 00:53:21,660
You shouldn't grimace
before you lunge.

903
00:53:21,694 --> 00:53:24,195
It gives away the game.

904
00:53:37,743 --> 00:53:40,045
<i>Bit of a quandary</i>
<i>for you.</i>

905
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,948
If you kill me,
you fail Lady Stark.

906
00:53:42,982 --> 00:53:45,584
<i>But if you don't kill me,</i>

907
00:53:45,618 --> 00:53:47,920
I'm going to kill you.

908
00:53:53,794 --> 00:53:55,628
You're good.

909
00:53:55,663 --> 00:53:57,864
Graceless, but good.

910
00:54:06,874 --> 00:54:09,142
See? If you were
willing to hurt me,

911
00:54:09,176 --> 00:54:10,977
you might have
had me there.

912
00:54:13,147 --> 00:54:15,348
( grunting )

913
00:54:17,284 --> 00:54:19,119
( grunts )

914
00:54:19,153 --> 00:54:22,155

915
00:54:28,096 --> 00:54:29,964

<i>( Jaime breathing heavily )</i>

<i>( horse neighs )</i>

918
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,126
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you,

919
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,195
if you can
call that a woman.

920
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,297
We enjoy a good fight.

921
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,599
Gets our juices flowing.

922
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:06,502
The Flayed Man
of House Bolton.

923
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,437
A bit gruesome
for my taste.

924
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:12,175
- You sure he's the one?
- That's him, all right.

925
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:14,009
I saw him fight
at the tourney

926
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,011
for Ser Willem Frey's
wedding.

927
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:20,249
Give the man his silver.

928
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:24,019
Let us go and my father will pay
you whatever you want.

929
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,322
Enough to buy me
a new head?

930
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:29,725
<i>If the King in the North</i>
<i>hears I had the Kingslayer</i>

931
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:32,628
and let him go,
he'll be taking it right off.

932
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,797
I'd rather he takes yours.
