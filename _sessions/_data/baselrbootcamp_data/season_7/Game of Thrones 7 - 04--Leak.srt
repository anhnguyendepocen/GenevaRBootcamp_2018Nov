Game of Thrones S07E043 "The Spoils of War"

3
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:11,850
Hold that wagon!

4
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:28,534
You've just won the biggest
prize in the world.

5
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:30,447
What could you possibly
have to be upset about?

6
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:33,648
Come on, you can tell me.

7
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:38,122
Queen of Thorns gave you one last prick
in the balls before saying goodbye?

8
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:40,550
I'll save my confessions
for the High Septon.

9
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:44,227
- There is no more High Septon.
- No, there isn't, is there?

10
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,807
There is still the question of my prize.

11
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,738
That's a lot of money I just gave you.

12
00:03:52,313 --> 00:03:53,624
It's not a castle.

13
00:03:55,254 --> 00:03:57,522
How about that one?  It's available.

14
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:59,280
You don't want Highgarden.

15
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:01,773
-I'd beg to differ.  -We're at  war.

16
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:04,778
Daenerys Targaryen could come and
take it back the day after you move in.

17
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:07,622
Besides, think of the upkeep.

18
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:10,627
The more you own, the
more it weighs you down.

19
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,959
Oh, is that why you're
so fucking glum, heh?

20
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:15,133
All your new riches weighing you down?

21
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:20,055
They're not mine. This all
belongs to the Iron Bank.

22
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:22,964
See?

23
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:25,937
We pay our debts.
- Right. Just not to me.

24
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,186
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
formerly Earth--

25
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:32,551
whatever name the shitheap you're from

26
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:36,515
with a saddlebag full of gold,
complaining about not getting paid.

27
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:41,309
When we win this war, all the castles in the
Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from

28
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:43,194
with no one left to take it away from you.

29
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:46,167
Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign
will be quiet and peaceful.

30
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,852
-Stranger things have happened -Like what?

31
00:04:50,802 --> 00:04:53,647
The granaries are being emptied and
loaded into wagons, my Lord.

32
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,733
The current harvest?

33
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:57,737
We have teams of men collecting it.
Modest farms in the Reach.

34
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,101
Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarlys

35
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,275
and help them acellerate this process?

36
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:04,257
I'm not much for shoveling weight.

37
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,157
No, but motivating reluctant farmers
to hand over the harvest.

38
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,225
I bet you're going to have
a real talent for that.

39
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:13,855
My Lord.

40
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,773
My Lord.

41
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,033
My Lord.

42
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,265
I must say, I don't think the iron Bank

43
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,214
has ever had a debt of this magnitude

44
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:35,963
repaid in a single installment.

45
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:39,861
I always considered your father a
very effective and efficient man

46
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:43,505
but you appear to be redefining
those terms entirely.

47
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:45,424
You're too kind, my Lord.

48
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:48,555
I'm neither kind nor a Lord, Your Grace.

49
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:51,528
I'm merely the instrument of
the institution I represent.

50
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:55,107
Its well-being is a matter of
arithmetic, not sentiment.

51
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,888
And the current arithmetic is outstanding.

52
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,308
The gold ...-is on its way.

53
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:03,930
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

54
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:07,891
Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.

55
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:10,577
They've grown rather fond
of your interest payments.

56
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,974
We must devise a way to
raise their spirits.

57
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:18,120
Yes, perhaps we could be of
assistance in some current venture.

58
00:06:18,982 --> 00:06:20,708
Our only venture this moment

59
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:22,817
is reestablishing control
over this continent

60
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,704
and every person on it.

61
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,218
I see a great deal of
potential in that venture.

62
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:31,830
I imagine it would require
outside investment.

63
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:33,173
It would, indeed.

64
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:35,379
I need to expand my armies, my navies.

65
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,200
My Hand, Qyburn,

66
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,724
has made overtures to the
Golden Company in Essos.

67
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:40,939
I know them well.

68
00:06:40,972 --> 00:06:42,898
They've helped us recover
significant sums from parties

69
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:45,542
who'd fall into deep areas.

70
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:46,821
It's good to hear.

71
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:50,369
I too would like them to recover
some things that belong to me.

72
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,234
Rest assured, Your Grace.

73
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:56,410
You can count on the Iron Bank support...

74
00:06:57,368 --> 00:06:59,542
as soon as the gold arrives.

75
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:04,943
This is for you.

76
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:12,133
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat

77
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,668
but your mother fought him off.

78
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:23,257
The other dagger,

79
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:25,718
the one that took her life.

80
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:29,840
I would have stopped that
dagger with my own heart

81
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:31,023
if I could have.

82
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,593
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

83
00:07:37,383 --> 00:07:38,823
But I am here for her now

84
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:41,762
to do what she would have done,

85
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,352
to protect her children.

86
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:50,296
Anything, I can do for you, Brandon.

87
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,885
You need only ask.

88
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:57,327
Do you know who this belonged to?

89
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,127
No.

90
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:04,550
A very question was what started
the War of Five Kings

91
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:08,066
In a way, that dagger made you
what you are today.

92
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,445
Forced from your home, driven after
the wilds beyond the Wall.

93
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:15,353
I imagine you've seen things

94
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:17,080
most men wouldn't believe.

95
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,351
To go through all of that and

96
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:33,252
make your way home again only to fnd
such chaos in the world.

97
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,543
-I can only imagine. -Chaos is a ladder.

98
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:50,798
I'm sorry to have disturbed
you, Lord Stark.

99
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,844
I'm not Lord Stark.

100
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:04,957
What's that?

101
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:09,143
Maester Wolkan built it for me.
So I can move around more easily.

102
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:10,646
It's a very good idea.

103
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:14,546
You're leaving.

104
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:19,147
I don't want to leave you, but when ...

105
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:23,111
when they come, I need
to be with my family.

106
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:25,029
And you're safe.

107
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:27,553
Safest anyone can be, now.

108
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,047
You don't need me anymore.

109
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:32,891
No, I don't.

110
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,868
That's all you've got to say?

111
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:41,137
Thank you.

112
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:43,831
Thank you?

113
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:46,091
For helping me.

114
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,830
My brother died for you.

115
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,771
Hodor and Summer died for you.

116
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:54,754
I almost died for you.

117
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:00,217
Bran ...

118
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,465
I'm not, really.

119
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:04,533
Not anymore.

120
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:10,094
I remember what it felt
like to be Brandon Stark.

121
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,195
I don't remember so much else now.

122
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:22,111
You died in that cave.

123
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,764
[Guards chatting]

124
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:05,707
[Guards chatting]

125
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:09,286
Hello. Where are you going?

126
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:11,682
In there.

127
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:14,303
-I live here. -Fuck off.

128
00:11:14,336 --> 00:11:16,221
I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.

129
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:21,623
Arya Stark's dead.

130
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:26,033
Send for me Ser Luwin or Ser Rodrik.

131
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:28,973
- They'll tell you who I am.
- There's no Rodrik here.

132
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:30,699
Maester's name Wolkan.

133
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,608
Go ask Jon Snow then,
the King in the North.

134
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:36,356
- He's my brother.-He's
a thousand miles away.

135
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:41,151
It's cold and we're busy. So
you know, better fuck off.

136
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:45,402
If Jon's gone, who's in
charge of Winterfell?

137
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:47,895
The Lady of Winterfell?

138
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:50,739
-Lady Stark? -Which Lady Stark?

139
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:53,648
You've told us you're the one
in person and her sister.

140
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,920
Tell Sansa her sister's home.

141
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:01,861
Lady Sansa is too busy to
waste a breath on you.

142
00:12:01,894 --> 00:12:05,825
Just like us. So for the
last time, fuck off.

143
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,377
I'm getting into this
castle one way or another.

144
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:15,702
If I'm not who I say I
am, I won't last long.

145
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:20,495
But if I am, and Sansa finds
out you turned me away...

146
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,540
All right. You sit there.

147
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:31,051
Right there.

148
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:33,567
Don't move.

149
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,987
Go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.

150
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,224
I ain't telling Lady Stark.

151
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:07,445
-You tell her. -I'm not.

152
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:11,378
Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit you right
 in fucking face as hard as I can.

153
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:21,828
We told her to wait.

154
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:23,746
We were standing right next to her and

155
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:25,727
- and when we turned
around, she gone m'lady.

156
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,582
She was nothing, some Winter Town girl.

157
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:30,458
She comes in, asking for Ser Rodrik.

158
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:32,567
and Maester Luwin . - Luwin, yeah.

159
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,211
And don't trouble yourself for it, m'lady.
We'll find her.

160
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:37,586
You don't have to.

161
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:39,120
I know where she is.

162
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,273
Do I have to call you Lady Stark, now?

163
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:00,214
Yes.

164
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,359
You shouldn't have run from the guards.

165
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,446
I didn't run.

166
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:23,002
You need better guards.

167
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:31,856
Suits you ... Lady Stark.

168
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,692
-Jon left you in charge? -He did.

169
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,526
I hope he comes back soon.

170
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,330
I remember how happy he was to see me.
When he sees you...

171
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:45,279
his heart will probably stop.

172
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,018
It doesn't look like him.

173
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:59,374
Should have been carved by
someone who knew his face.

174
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:02,282
Everyone who knew his face is dead.

175
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:05,457
We're not.

176
00:15:11,296 --> 00:15:13,405
They say you killed Joffrey.

177
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:14,651
Did you?

178
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:16,922
I wish I had.

179
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,829
Me too.

180
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:22,674
I was angry when I heard
someone else had done it.

181
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,435
However long my list go,
he was always first.

182
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,792
-Your list? -Of people I'm going to kill.

183
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:42,138
How did you get back to Winterfell?

184
00:15:43,353 --> 00:15:46,804
It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.

185
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:47,860
Yes.

186
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:50,416
Not a very pleasant one.

187
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,399
Mine neither.

188
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:58,151
But our stories aren't over yet.

189
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,027
No, they're not.

190
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:09,154
Arya.

191
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:14,067
Bran's home, too.

192
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:51,910
You came home.

193
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:07,187
I saw you at the crossroads.

194
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,757
-You saw me? -I see quite a lot now.

195
00:17:12,492 --> 00:17:15,752
Bran has... visions.

196
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:19,141
I thought you might go to King's Landing.

197
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,537
So did I.

198
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,135
Why would you go back there?

199
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,597
Cersei's on her list of names.

200
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:38,796
Who else is on your list?

201
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:40,363
Most of them are dead already.

202
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,253
Where did you get this?

203
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:54,745
Littlefinger gave it to me.

204
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:57,973
Littlefinger? He's here?

205
00:17:58,006 --> 00:18:01,712
He's declared for House Stark.
Why would he give you a dagger?

206
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:03,150
He thought I'd want it.

207
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,547
-Why? -Because it was meant to kill me.

208
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:07,594
The cutthroat.

209
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:09,575
After your fall?

210
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,314
Why would the cutthroat has
Valyrian steel dagger?

211
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:15,998
Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.

212
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:17,150
He's not a generous man.

213
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:20,314
He wouldn't give you anything unless
he thought he was getting something back.

214
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:25,778
- It doesn't matter. -What do
you mean it doesn't matter?

215
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:26,834
I don't want it.

216
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:32,619
Are you sure?

217
00:18:33,706 --> 00:18:36,550
- It's Valyrian steel.
- It's wasted on a cripple.

218
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:13,754
Catelyn Stark would be proud.

219
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,565
You kept your vow.

220
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:20,048
- I did next to nothing.
- You're too hard on yourself, my Lady.

221
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:21,359
I'm not a...

222
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:26,218
Thank you, Podrick.

223
00:19:43,701 --> 00:19:46,672
Your Grace. There's still
no word on the Unsullied.

224
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:47,760
Soon.

225
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,901
He will come back to you.

226
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,065
He better.

227
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:56,805
What happened?

228
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:59,362
Many things.

229
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:03,837
Many things?

230
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:06,681
Your Grace.

231
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:13,553
It's all right.

232
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:37,172
I wanted you to see it before
we start hacking it to bits.

233
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:16,100
Well, this is it. All we ever need.

234
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:24,397
There is something else
I want to show you, Your Grace.

235
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:51,928
The Children of the Forest made these.

236
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:52,961
When?

237
00:21:58,673 --> 00:22:00,175
A very long time ago.

238
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:07,302
They were right here, standing
where we're standing.

239
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:11,713
Before there were Targaryens,
or Starks or Lannisters.

240
00:22:13,343 --> 00:22:15,516
Maybe even before there were men.

241
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:17,156
No.

242
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:29,355
They were here together,

243
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,166
the Children and the First Men.

244
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:34,214
Doing what? Fighting each other?

245
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:45,655
They fought together

246
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:48,308
against their common enemy.

247
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:52,367
Despite their differences,
despite their suspicions.

248
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:56,074
Together.

249
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,262
We need to do the same
if we're gonna survive.

250
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:05,792
Because the enemy is real.

251
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:09,435
It's always been real.

252
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:21,099
And you say you can't defeat them

253
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:23,402
without my armies and my dragons.

254
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:26,598
No, I don't think I can.

255
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:36,665
I will fight for you.

256
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,126
I will fight for the North.

257
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:44,816
When you bend the knee.

258
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:51,815
My people

259
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,650
won't accept a Southern ruler.

260
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:58,112
Not after everything they've suffered.

261
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:03,450
They will if their King does.

262
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:07,157
They chose you to lead them.

263
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:10,321
They chose you to protect them.

264
00:24:12,142 --> 00:24:15,371
Isn't their survival more
important than your pride?

265
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:35,697
What is it?

266
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:38,798
We took Casterly Rock.

267
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:40,716
That's very good to hear.

268
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,510
Isn't it?

269
00:24:54,364 --> 00:24:56,439
You'll want to discuss
this amongst yourselves.

270
00:24:56,472 --> 00:24:57,750
Perhaps-- -You stay.

271
00:24:59,189 --> 00:25:00,818
All my allies have gone.

272
00:25:00,851 --> 00:25:04,663
They've been taken from me while
 I've been sitting here on this island.
 -You sill have the largest armies.

273
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,913
We won't be able to eat because Cersei
has taken all the food from the Reach.

274
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:09,895
Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.

275
00:25:09,928 --> 00:25:12,580
We still have enough ships to carry
the Dothraki to the Mainland.

276
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:14,753
Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.

277
00:25:14,786 --> 00:25:17,821
- We have a plan, it's still the right plan.
 -The right plan?

278
00:25:17,854 --> 00:25:21,274
Your strategy has lost us Dorne,
the Iron Islands and the Reach.

279
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,894
If I have underestimated our enemies ...

280
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:25,300
Our enemies?

281
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,548
Your family you mean.

282
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,520
Perhaps you don't want to
hurt them after all.

283
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:42,176
Enough with the clever plans.
I have three large dragons.

284
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,253
I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.

285
00:25:44,286 --> 00:25:45,500
We've discussed this--

286
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:47,930
My enemies are in the Red Keep.

287
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:51,549
What kind of a Queen am I if I'm
not willing to risk my life to fight them?

288
00:25:51,573 --> 00:25:52,757
A smart one.

289
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:58,317
What do you think I should do?

290
00:26:01,002 --> 00:26:03,142
-I would never presume ...-I'm at war.

291
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:04,198
I'm losing.

292
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,034
What do you think I should do?

293
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:16,790
I never thought that
dragons would exist again.

294
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:17,973
No one did.

295
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:21,775
The people who follow you

296
00:26:21,808 --> 00:26:24,526
know that you made something
impossible happen.

297
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:30,279
Maybe their hopes and belief that you
can make other impossible things happen.

298
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:34,529
Build a world that's different from
the shit one they've always known.

299
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:40,122
But if you use them to mount
castles and burn cities

300
00:26:41,464 --> 00:26:42,679
you're not different.

301
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:45,779
You're just more of the same.

302
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:02,079
Don't lunge.

303
00:27:14,225 --> 00:27:16,047
Don't go where your enemy leads you.

304
00:27:18,189 --> 00:27:19,211
Up.

305
00:27:24,261 --> 00:27:26,861
- And don't ...
- Don't fight someone like her in the first place.

306
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,009
Nice sword.

307
00:27:36,182 --> 00:27:37,429
Very nice dagger.

308
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,240
If they haven't contributed
 the right amount of grain to the stores

309
00:27:47,273 --> 00:27:50,393
then I'm afraid they'll have to make do
with what they've brought. They can't--

310
00:27:54,944 --> 00:27:56,294
It's been a while since I trained.

311
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:59,097
I can go find the
Master of Arms for you, my Lady.

312
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,856
He didn't beat The Hound.

313
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,678
You did.

314
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:04,948
I want to train with you.

315
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:10,700
You swore to serve both my
 mother's daughters? Didn't you?

316
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:19,937
Move aside, Podrick.

317
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:26,903
You can't use that, my Lady.
It's too small.

318
00:28:26,936 --> 00:28:28,919
I won't cut you. Don't worry.

319
00:28:30,229 --> 00:28:31,795
I'll try not to.

320
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,934
Who taught you how to do that?

321
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:47,967
No one.

322
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:23,467
-What do you think of her? -Who?

323
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:27,815
I believe you know of whom I speak.

324
00:30:28,548 --> 00:30:30,274
I think she has a good heart.

325
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:31,393
A good heart?

326
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:34,269
I've noticed you
staring at her good heart.

327
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,347
There's no time for that.

328
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:40,022
I saw the Night King, Davos.
I looked into his eyes.

329
00:30:41,462 --> 00:30:43,825
How many men do we have in
the North to fight him?

330
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:46,350
-10000? Less? -Fewer.

331
00:30:46,383 --> 00:30:47,405
What?

332
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:50,601
Speaking of good hearts,
Missandei of Naath.

333
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:53,927
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

334
00:30:54,532 --> 00:30:56,098
King Snow. Isn't it?

335
00:30:56,131 --> 00:30:57,504
No, that doesn't sound right.

336
00:30:57,537 --> 00:30:59,551
-King Jon? -It doesn't matter.

337
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,374
Forgive me, but may I ask a question?

338
00:31:02,203 --> 00:31:03,386
Of course.

339
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:05,176
Your name is Jon Snow,

340
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:07,478
but your father's name was Ned Stark.

341
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,587
I'm a bastard.

342
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:13,357
My mother and father weren't married.

343
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,722
Is the custom different in Naath?

344
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:19,815
We don't have marriage in Naath, so
the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.

345
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,755
That sounds ... liberating?

346
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:27,612
Why did you leave your home land?

347
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:30,009
I was stolen away by slavers.

348
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:31,097
I'm sorry.

349
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,206
If I may,

350
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:36,306
how did a slave girl come to advise
Daenerys Targaryen?

351
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:40,108
She bought me from my
master and set me free.

352
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:41,292
That was good of her.

353
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:44,520
Of course you're serving
her now, aren't you?

354
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:48,484
I serve my Queen because I want
to serve my Queen.

355
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:51,232
Because I believe in her.

356
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,267
And if you wanted to sail
home to Naath tomorrow?

357
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,337
Then she would give me a a ship
and wish me good fortune.

358
00:31:58,679 --> 00:31:59,862
You believe that?

359
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:01,844
I know it.

360
00:32:02,802 --> 00:32:04,911
All of us who came with her from Essos,

361
00:32:04,944 --> 00:32:06,382
we believe in her.

362
00:32:07,341 --> 00:32:10,792
She's not our Queen because she's the
daughter of some King we never knew.

363
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:14,116
She's the Queen we chose.

364
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:18,495
Will you forgive me if I switch sides?

365
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:25,143
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

366
00:32:41,955 --> 00:32:43,010
Stop!

367
00:33:07,395 --> 00:33:08,395
Jon.

368
00:33:11,774 --> 00:33:13,340
I didn't know you were here.

369
00:33:20,405 --> 00:33:21,491
Sansa ...

370
00:33:23,728 --> 00:33:24,974
is she all right?

371
00:33:27,116 --> 00:33:28,522
What you did for her

372
00:33:29,896 --> 00:33:32,197
is the only reason I'm not killing you.

373
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:42,265
We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.

374
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,301
We thought you were dead.

375
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:46,421
I should be.

376
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,114
Your sister?

377
00:33:50,032 --> 00:33:51,087
Euron has her.

378
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:54,347
I came to ask the Queen to
help me get her back.

379
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,758
The Queen is gone.

380
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:01,986
Where did she go?

381
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:25,060
- All the gold safely to the gates
of King's Landing. - Good.

382
00:34:25,093 --> 00:34:28,896
We need to get the last of these wagons to
Blackwater Rush before nightfall.

383
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:32,348
The head of the line is ambushed, the tail
will never be able to reinforce in time.

384
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:33,977
We are stretched a bit thin.

385
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,384
With your permission,

386
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:38,804
flogging stragglers has a
marked effect on mobility.

387
00:34:40,116 --> 00:34:42,831
Let's give them fair warning first.

388
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:44,973
These men fought well at Highgarden.

389
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:04,150
- Ser Jaime.
- Rickon.

390
00:35:05,045 --> 00:35:06,045
Dickon.

391
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:11,724
I hear you fought brave near Highgarden.

392
00:35:11,757 --> 00:35:13,163
First battle?

393
00:35:14,472 --> 00:35:15,472
And ...?

394
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:18,275
It was glorious.

395
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:20,258
Come on! Your father is not here.

396
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:24,381
All my life, we've been
pledged to House Tyrell.

397
00:35:25,052 --> 00:35:27,577
I knew some of those men, hunted with them.

398
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:29,751
They didn't deserve to die.

399
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:34,608
But Lady Olenna chose to betray her Queen
and support the Targaryen girl.

400
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:35,664
So here we are.

401
00:35:37,517 --> 00:35:39,403
I didn't expect it to smell like that.

402
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:41,575
Men shit themselves when they die.

403
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:44,005
Didn't they teach you that at
fancy lad school?

404
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:47,201
I learnt it when I was five.

405
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:55,328
What?

406
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:57,502
Listen.

407
00:36:09,255 --> 00:36:12,131
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

408
00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:14,431
-What is it? -Get in line!

409
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,054
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

410
00:36:18,747 --> 00:36:20,377
Get in line, now!

411
00:36:21,495 --> 00:36:22,550
Line up!

412
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:23,733
Come on, lads!

413
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,937
Halt those wagons! Full array!

414
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,377
Full array!

415
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:32,171
Grab your spears!

416
00:36:38,883 --> 00:36:40,608
Shield wall!

417
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:43,933
Fill the gaps!

418
00:36:49,015 --> 00:36:50,707
Sit tight!

419
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,307
Get in line, boys!

420
00:37:23,756 --> 00:37:26,249
Spears, out!

421
00:37:29,701 --> 00:37:30,947
Spears, out!

422
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:33,824
Hold the line!

423
00:37:42,613 --> 00:37:44,050
Get back to King's Landing.

424
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:47,310
I'm not abandoning my army. - You're the
Commander, not a damn infantry man.

425
00:37:47,343 --> 00:37:49,102
These fuckers are about to slomp us.

426
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,106
We can hold them off.

427
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:10,835
Dracarys!

428
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:48,421
Hold the line!

429
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:50,595
Hold the line!

430
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:54,366
Hold the line!

431
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:03,752
-Archers. -Archers.

432
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:05,415
Archers, follow me!

433
00:40:06,662 --> 00:40:07,908
Get in line!

434
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:14,917
Nock!

435
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:27,861
Loose!

436
00:40:47,221 --> 00:40:49,808
- Qyburn's Scorpion is over there.
- Go get it then.

437
00:40:49,841 --> 00:40:51,600
I can't shoot with one hand.

438
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:54,700
Come on!

439
00:43:06,443 --> 00:43:07,754
Where are you?

440
00:43:30,222 --> 00:43:32,204
Your people do not know how to fight.

441
00:44:15,544 --> 00:44:16,949
Take cover!

442
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:12,785
Come on, you fucker.

443
00:45:12,818 --> 00:45:14,128
Dracarys!

444
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:25,625
Flee, you idiot.

445
00:46:26,904 --> 00:46:28,566
Come on, boy. Come on!

446
00:46:37,195 --> 00:46:38,696
You f--

447
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,328
You fucking idiot.

448
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:15,430
