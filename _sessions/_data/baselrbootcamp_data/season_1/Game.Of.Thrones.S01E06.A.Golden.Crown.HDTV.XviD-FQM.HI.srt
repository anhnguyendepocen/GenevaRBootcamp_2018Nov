Your pardon, Your Grace.

6
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,262
I would rise, but...

7
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:31,698
Cersei: <i>Do you know what</i>
<i>your wife has done?</i>

8
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,202
She did nothing
I did not command.

9
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:36,970
Who'd have thought
she had it in her?

10
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:39,039
By what right dare you lay
hands on my blood?

11
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:40,634
I am the King's Hand, charged
with keeping the peace...

12
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,261
You <i>were</i> the King's Hand.

13
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,279
You shall now be held
accountable.

14
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:46,315
Oh, will both of you
shut your mouths?!

15
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:51,954
Catelyn will release Tyrion and
you'll make your peace with Jaime.

16

He butchered my men--

Lord Stark was
returning drunk

18
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:58,660
from a brothel
when his men attacked Jaime.

19
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:02,264
- Quiet, woman.
- <i>Jaime has fled the city.</i>

20
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:05,233
Give me leave to bring him
back to justice.

21
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:09,004
I took you for a King.

22

- Hold your tongue.
- <i>He's attacked</i>

23

one of my brothers
and abducted the other.

24
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:15,677
I should wear the armor
and you the gown.

25
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,091
I shall wear this
like a badge of honor.

26
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:36,464
Wear it in silence
or I'll honor you again.

See what she does to me?

29
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:55,715
My loving wife.

30
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:03,757
I should not have
hit her.

31
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,893
That was not...

32
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:09,196
That was not Kingly.

33
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,635
If we don't act,

34
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,971
there will be a war.

35
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,874
So tell your wife to return
that little shit of an Imp

36
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:22,310
to King's Landing.

37
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,013
She's had her fun,
now put an end to it.

38
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,318
You hear me?
Send a raven and put an end to it.

39
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,154
And what about
Jaime Lannister?

40
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,460
- What about Jaime?
- I'm half a Kingdom in debt

41
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:39,862
to his bloody father.

42
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:43,800
I don't know what happened between
you and those yellow-haired shits.

43
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:46,570
I don't want to know.
This is what matters--

44
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:48,639
I can't rule the Kingdoms

45
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:51,675
if the Starks and the Lannisters
are at each other's throats.

46
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,944
So enough.

47
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:58,283
As you command,
Your Grace.

48
00:04:58,317 --> 00:05:00,786
With your leave,

49
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,955
I will return to Winterfell
and set matters straight.

50
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,891
Piss on that.
Send a raven.

51
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:07,559
I want you to stay.

52
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:10,663
I'm the King.
I get what I want.

53
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:18,870
I never loved my brothers.

54
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:22,608
A sad thing for a man
to admit, but it's true.

55
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:28,481
You were the brother
I chose.

56

We'll talk when I return
from the hunt.

57
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,294
The hunt?

58
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:44,732
Killing things
clears my head.

59
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:47,502
You'll have to sit on the
throne while I'm away.

60

You'll hate it more than I do.

61

The Targaryen girl--

62
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,609
seven hells,
don't start with her again.

63
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:58,479
The girl will die
and I'll hear no more of it.

64
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:01,549
Put on the badge.
And if you ever take it off again,

65
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:05,686
I swear to the mother I'll pin the
damned thing on Jaime Lannister.

Not now.

- Blood for blood.
- Bran: Come on!

80

You need to make the Lannisters
pay for Jory and the others.

They attacked your father.
They've already started the war.

89
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:15,200
It's your duty to represent your
House when your father can't.

90
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:18,871
And it's not your duty,

All alone in the deep,
dark woods.

98

I'm not alone.
My brother is with me.

99

I don't see him.

100

Got him hidden
under your cloak?

Ooh, that's a pretty pin.

Get down.

Cut his little cock off

00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:45,963
I don't care about
stupid wooden swords.

161
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:47,831
You are troubled.

162
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:49,533
- Yes.
- <i>Good!</i>

163
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,802
Trouble is the perfect
time for training.

164
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:55,139
When you are dancing in the meadow
with your dolls and kittens,

165
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:57,108
this is not
when fighting happens.

166
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,411
I don't like

<i>( Tisks )</i>
<i>Just so.</i>

173
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:20,299
How can you be
quick as a snake...

174
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:26,505
...Or as quiet
as a shadow...

175
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:33,579
...When you are
somewhere else?

176
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:38,217
You are fearing
for your father, hmm?

177
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:42,721
That is right.

178
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:45,991
- Do you pray to the gods?
- The old and the new.

179
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:50,330
There is only one God

180
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:53,267
and his name is Death.

181
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:56,303
And there is only one thing
we say to Death:

182
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:59,406
"Not today."

183

She's going
to have a boy.

He won't be
a real Targaryen.

Once, perhaps.

If I sell one egg,
I'll have enough to buy a ship.

I'm the last hope

I was five years old--

Never.

Not a piece of it.

Hmm?

You can have her.

You swore
an oath to me.

Does loyalty
mean nothing to you?

Sometimes possession

266

( groans )

268
00:22:30,837 --> 00:22:33,372
When they captured me,
they took my purse,

269
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:35,374
but the gold
is still mine.

270

Where?

271
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,311
Where?
I don't know where,

272
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:40,645
but when they free me--

273
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,080
You want free?

274
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:45,350
Go be free.

00:22:58,363 --> 00:23:01,199
You know who

I am a Lannister.

Tyrion, son of Tywin!

282
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:12,879
And of course,
you have also heard the phrase,

"a Lannister always
pays his debts."

Tell her I wish

( Metal tapping,

You wish to confess

Yes, My Lady.

Where do I begin,
my lords and ladies?

I'm a vile man,

I confess it.

301
00:24:24,587 --> 00:24:27,589
My crimes and sins
are beyond counting.

<i>I'm not particularly</i>

others to do violence for me.

You want specifics,
I suppose.

When I was seven

I stole her robe.

She was forced to return
to the castle

naked and in tears.

312

<i>When confronted</i>
<i>with my crime,</i>

I blamed a squire.
Poor boy was flogged

317
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:18,673

<i>When I was 12</i>

319

I milked my eel
into a pot of turtle stew.

320
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:26,582
- ( Gasps )
- I flogged the one-eyed snake.

321
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:28,617
I skinned my sausage.

322
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,854
I made the bald man cry

323
00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:33,890
<i>into the turtle stew,</i>

324
00:25:33,924 --> 00:25:35,925
which I do believe
my sister ate.

325
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,894
<i>At least I hope she did.</i>

326
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:40,262
Once I brought a jackass
and a honeycomb

327
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:42,464
- into a brothel--
- Silence!

328
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:44,099
What happened next?

329
00:25:45,101 --> 00:25:48,135
What do you think
you're doing?

330
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,104
Confessing my crimes.

331
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:52,673
Lord Tyrion,
you are accused

332
00:25:52,707 --> 00:25:56,177
of hiring a man to slay
my son Bran in his bed,

333
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:59,014
<i>and of conspiring to murder</i>
<i>my sister's husband</i>

334
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:02,885
Lord Jon Arryn,
the Hand of the King.

335
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:05,254
Oh, I'm very sorry.

336
00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:08,358
I don't know anything
about all that.

337
00:26:09,494 --> 00:26:11,729
You've had
your little joke.

338
00:26:11,763 --> 00:26:14,132
I trust you enjoyed it.

339
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:17,035
Mord, take him back
to the dungeon.

340
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:19,403
But this time find
a smaller cell...

341
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,539
With a steeper floor.

342
00:26:21,574 --> 00:26:24,342
Is this how justice

343
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,244
is done in the Vale?

344
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:28,846
<i>You accuse me</i>
<i>of crimes,</i>

345
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:32,049
I deny them,
so you throw me into a cell

346
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,951
<i>to freeze and starve?</i>

347
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:36,921
Where is
the King's Justice?

348
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:40,325
I am accused
and demand a trial!

349
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,027
<i>( Courtiers murmuring )</i>

350
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:43,996
If you're tried
and found guilty,

351
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:47,133
then by the King's own laws
you will pay with your life.

352
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:50,270
I understand the law.

353
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:52,872
We have no executioner
in the Eyrie.

354
00:26:52,907 --> 00:26:55,709
Life is more elegant here.

355
00:26:55,743 --> 00:26:57,677
Open the moon door.

356
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:12,924
( Robin giggling )

357
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,299
Lysa: <i>You want a trial,</i>
<i>My Lord Lannister.</i>

358
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,334
Very well.

359
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:26,337
My son will listen
to whatever you have to say,

360
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:28,639
and you will hear
his judgment.

361
00:27:28,674 --> 00:27:30,775
Then you will leave...

362
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,944
By one door
or the other.

363
00:27:32,978 --> 00:27:36,180
No need to bother
Lord Robin.

364
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:39,851
- I demand a trial by combat.
- ( Laughter )

365
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:50,361
You have that right.

366
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,331
My Lady, I beg the honor.

367
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:55,333
Let me be your champion.

368
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:57,768
The honor should be mine.

369
00:27:57,803 --> 00:28:00,037
For the love I bore
your Lord husband,

370
00:28:00,072 --> 00:28:01,873
let me avenge his death.

371
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:04,442
- <i>I'll fight for you, My Lady.</i>
- It'll be my honor.

372
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:07,811
- The honor should be mine.
- Make the bad man fly!

373
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,782
Ser Vardis...

374
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,985
You're quiet.

375
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:15,919
Don't you want
to avenge my husband?

376
00:28:17,922 --> 00:28:20,491
With all my heart,
My Lady.

377
00:28:20,525 --> 00:28:22,459
But the Imp
is half my size.

378
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:25,628
It would be shameful to slaughter
such a man and call it justice.

379
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,731
Agreed.

380
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:30,700
You demanded
a trial by combat.

381
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:34,070
Now I demand a champion.
I have that right, same as you.

382
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:36,072
My Lady,

383
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:39,576
I will gladly fight
the Imp's champion for you.

384
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,112
I wouldn't be
too glad, Ser.

385
00:28:42,146 --> 00:28:44,648
I name my brother
Jaime Lannister.

386
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,883
- ( Whispering )
- Lysa: <i>The Kingslayer</i>

387
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:48,885
is hundreds of miles
from here.

388
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:51,521
Send a raven for him.
I'm happy to wait.

389
00:28:52,423 --> 00:28:54,591
The trial will be today.

390
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:00,097
Do I have a volunteer?

391
00:29:00,132 --> 00:29:02,300
( Laughter )

392
00:29:07,907 --> 00:29:10,475
- Anyone?
- ( Giggling )

393
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,511
Anyone?

394
00:29:15,448 --> 00:29:17,749
I think we can assume
that no one is willing--

395
00:29:17,783 --> 00:29:19,818
I'll stand
for the dwarf.

396
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,430
Lancel:
More wine, Your Grace?

397
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:37,868
- What was I saying?
- Renly: Simpler time.

398
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:41,239
It was! It was.
You're too young to remember.

399
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:42,974
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

400
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:46,478
- It was, Your Grace.
- The enemy was right  in the open,

401
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:50,716
vicious as you like, all but
sending you a bloody invitation.

402
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:52,719
Nothing like today.

403
00:29:52,753 --> 00:29:55,621
- It sounds exhilarating.
- Exhilarating, yes.

404
00:29:55,655 --> 00:29:58,023
Not as exhilarating
as those balls

405
00:29:58,058 --> 00:30:00,459
and masquerades
you like to throw.

406
00:30:00,493 --> 00:30:02,594
( Laughing )

407
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:07,865
You ever fuck
a Riverlands girl?

408
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:09,533
Once.
I think.

409
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:13,370
You think?
I think you'd remember.

410
00:30:13,404 --> 00:30:16,339
Back in our day,
you weren't a real man

411
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:19,476
until you'd fucked one girl
from each of the Seven Kingdoms

412
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:21,245
and the Riverlands.

413
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,515
- We used to call it "making the eight."
- Those were some <i>lucky</i> girls.

414
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:26,584
You ever make
the eight, Barristan?

415
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,586
I don't believe so,
Your Grace.

416
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,488
( Laughs )
Those were the days.

417
00:30:30,522 --> 00:30:32,290
Which days, exactly?

418
00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:35,827
The ones where half of Westeros
fought the other half and millions died?

419
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:39,097
Or before that, when the Mad King
slaughtered women and babies

420
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:42,033
because the voices in his head
told him they deserved it?

421
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:45,436
Or way before that, when dragons
burned whole cities to the ground?

422
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,638
Easy, boy.

423
00:30:47,673 --> 00:30:50,641
You might be my brother,
but you're speaking to the King.

424
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:52,410
I suppose it was all
rather heroic...

425
00:30:52,444 --> 00:30:55,279
If you were drunk enough
and had some poor Riverlands whore

426
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:57,948
to shove your prick inside
and make the eight.

427
00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:03,922
More wine, Your Grace?

428
00:31:19,974 --> 00:31:23,810
Man: <i>They burned most everything</i>
<i>in the Riverlands:</i>

429
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:28,014
<i>Our fields;</i>
<i>Our granaries;</i>

430
00:31:28,048 --> 00:31:30,450
our homes.

431
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:34,620
<i>They took our women,</i>
<i>then they took 'em again.</i>

432
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:37,256
When they was done,
they butchered them

433
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:39,092
as if they was animals.

434
00:31:39,126 --> 00:31:41,261
They covered our children

435
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:43,097
in pitch

436
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:45,032
and lit them on fire.

437
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:48,202
Brigands, most likely.

438
00:31:48,237 --> 00:31:50,606
They weren't thieves.

439
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,242
They didn't steal
nothing.

440
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:56,678
They even left something behind,
Your Grace.

441
00:31:56,713 --> 00:32:00,115
It's the King's Hand
you're addressing, not the King.

442
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:02,083
The King is hunting.

443
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:05,219
( Squelches )

444
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:07,621
<i>( Groans )</i>

Fish.
The Sigil of House Tully.

446
00:32:13,428 --> 00:32:17,198
( Whispers )
Isn't that your wife's house--
Tully, My Lord Hand?

447
00:32:21,836 --> 00:32:25,272
These men,
were they flying a Sigil?

448
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:29,076
- A banner?
- None, your--

449
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,711
Hand.

450
00:32:30,745 --> 00:32:32,579
<i>The one who was</i>
<i>leading them...</i>

451
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:36,117
Taller by a foot
than any man I've ever met,

452
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:39,487
saw him cut
the blacksmith in two,

453
00:32:39,521 --> 00:32:41,922
saw him take the head
off a horse

454
00:32:41,957 --> 00:32:44,459
with a single swing
of his sword.

455
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:47,028
That sounds like
someone we know.

456
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:49,164
The Mountain.

457
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:52,267
You're describing
Ser Gregor Clegane.

458
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:55,270
Why should Ser Gregor
turn brigand?

459
00:32:55,304 --> 00:32:57,471
The man is
an anointed knight.

460
00:32:57,506 --> 00:33:00,574
I've heard him called
Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

461
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:02,844
I'm sure you have
as well.

462
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:04,879
Can you think
of any reason

463
00:33:04,913 --> 00:33:06,714
the Lannisters
might possibly have

464
00:33:06,748 --> 00:33:08,416
for being angry
with your wife?

465
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,218
Maester Pycelle:
<i>If the Lannisters</i>

466

under the King's
protection,

468
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:18,626
- it would be--
- That would be almost as brazen

469
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,695
as attacking the Hand of the King
in the streets of the capital.

470
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,132
Well...

471
00:33:27,904 --> 00:33:30,272
I cannot give you

Lord Beric Dondarrion.

476
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:48,790
You shall have the command.
Assemble 100 men

477
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:52,527
- and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
- As you command.

478
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:02,737
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

479
00:34:02,762 --> 00:34:02,771
the first of his name,

480
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:06,642
King of the Andals and the first men,
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

481
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:08,911
and protector of the realm,

482
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,180
I charge you to bring
the King's Justice

483
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,250
to the false knight
Gregor Clegane

484
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,752
and all those
who shared in his crimes.

485
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,688
I denounce him

486
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,690
- and attaint him.
- <i>( Murmuring )</i>

487
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,026
I strip him of all
ranks and titles,

488
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,729
<i>of all lands and holdings,</i>

489
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:30,133
- and sentence him to death.
- My Lord...

490
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:33,135
This-- this is
a drastic action.

491
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,938
It would be better to wait
for King Robert's return.

492
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,407
- Grand Maester Pycelle.
- My Lord.

493
00:34:38,442 --> 00:34:40,811
Send a raven
to Casterly Rock.

494
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:44,181
Inform Tywin Lannister that
he has been summoned to court

495
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:46,283
<i>to answer for the crimes</i>
<i>of his bannermen.</i>

496
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:50,454
He will arrive within the fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown

497
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:54,158
and a traitor
to the realm.

498
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:10,142
( Softly )
A bold move, My Lord,
and admirable.

499
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:12,711
But is it wise
to yank the lion's tail?

500
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:16,248
Tywin Lannister is the richest man
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

501
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,319
Gold wins wars,
not soldiers.

502
00:35:20,353 --> 00:35:22,688
Then how come
Robert is King

503
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:25,024
and not Tywin Lannister?

504

No.

Can I make

Not this little man.

This little man

<i>( Coins jingle )</i>

A Lannister always

You wear your hair like
a real southern lady now.

536

Well, why shouldn't I?
We're in the South.

537
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:13,018
It's important to remember where
you come from.

538
00:40:13,052 --> 00:40:16,288
I'm not sure your mother would
like these new styles.

539
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:19,025
My mother isn't
<i>from</i> the North.

540
00:40:20,394 --> 00:40:22,228
I'm aware of that.

541
00:40:22,262 --> 00:40:24,063
Why do you care?

542
00:40:24,097 --> 00:40:25,765
Do you even have hair
under there?

543

Yes.
I have hair.

No.

Where are you from anyway?
The North or the South?

548
00:40:41,682 --> 00:40:44,250
I come from a very
small village in--

Oh, wait.

550
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:48,021
I just realized
I don't care.

551
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:50,290
- Sansa--
- Septa.

552

- Now you are being rude.

Septa:

554
00:41:03,905 --> 00:41:05,872
My prince.

555
00:41:05,907 --> 00:41:07,507
My Lady.

556
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:11,077
I fear I have
behaved monstrously

557
00:41:11,112 --> 00:41:13,980
the past few weeks.

558
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:18,150
With your permission?

559
00:41:30,562 --> 00:41:33,230
It's beautiful,

560
00:41:33,265 --> 00:41:35,332
like the one
your mother wears.

561
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,334
You'll be queen someday.

562
00:41:37,368 --> 00:41:40,170
It's only fitting
you should look the part.

563
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,345
Will you forgive me
for my rudeness?

564
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,316
There's nothing to forgive.

565
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:54,721
You're My Lady.

566
00:41:54,755 --> 00:41:57,924
One day we'll be married
in the throne room.

567
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:01,894
Lords and ladies from all over
the Seven Kingdoms will come,

568
00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:04,196
from the last hearth
in the North

569
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,166
to the Salt Shore
in the South,

570
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,436
and you will be Queen
over all of them.

571

<i>I'll never</i>
<i>disrespect you again.</i>

572
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:19,344
I'll never be cruel
to you again.

Do you understand me?

574
00:42:23,516 --> 00:42:25,751
You're My Lady now,

575
00:42:25,785 --> 00:42:29,221
from this day

576
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,024
until my last day.

577
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:56,216
Stop.

578
00:42:56,251 --> 00:42:58,819
- Stop!
- Whoa.

579
00:43:00,221 --> 00:43:02,755
- What are you doing?
- Going to King's Landing.

580
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,891
In a turnip cart?

581
00:43:04,925 --> 00:43:07,927
I'll find a ship heading
south in White Harbor.

582
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:10,796
And you can afford that?

583
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,531
Some of my friends are more
generous than others.

584
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:16,234
There's a thousand
girls like you in King's Landing.

585
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,536
So I'll have
lots of company.

586
00:43:18,571 --> 00:43:20,272
Yes, you'll be
very popular...

587
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,007
Until some fat lord
comes to visit

588
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:23,909
with a big belly
and a little prick

589
00:43:23,944 --> 00:43:26,446
and he can't get it up
so he knocks all your teeth out.

590

( Chuckles )
And what will happen
to me if I stay here?

591
00:43:29,383 --> 00:43:31,318
Will I become
Lady Greyjoy,

592
00:43:31,352 --> 00:43:34,422
- mistress of the Iron Islands?
- Don't be a fool.

593
00:43:34,456 --> 00:43:36,590
I hear Jaime Lannister
attacked Lord Stark

594
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,392
in the streets
of King's Landing.

595
00:43:38,427 --> 00:43:42,296
Every man for a hundred miles will be
marching off to war soon

596
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,297
and most of them
will never come back.

597
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:46,333
There's nothing left
for me here.

598
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:49,669
Let's go, Stefon.

599

00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,807
See what?

I'm going to miss you.

605
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,222
I know.

606
00:44:25,002 --> 00:44:27,037
I'm sending you both
back to Winterfell.

607
00:44:27,071 --> 00:44:28,471
- What?!
- Listen--

608
00:44:28,505 --> 00:44:31,107
- What about Joffrey?
- Are you dying because of your leg?

609
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:32,420
<i>Is that why</i>
<i>you're sending us home?</i>

610

What? No.

611
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,044
Please, father.
Please don't.

612
00:44:35,078 --> 00:44:37,246
You can't.
I've got my lessons with Syrio.

613
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,881
I'm finally
getting good.

614
00:44:38,915 --> 00:44:41,350
This isn't
a punishment.

615
00:44:41,384 --> 00:44:43,786
I want you back in Winterfell
for your own safety.

616
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,254
Can we take Syrio
back with us?

617
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:46,860
Who cares about your
stupid dancing teacher?

618
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:48,185
I can't go.

619
00:44:48,192 --> 00:44:50,060
I'm supposed to marry
Prince Joffrey.

620
00:44:50,094 --> 00:44:51,996
I love him and I'm meant
to be his Queen

621
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,632
- and have his babies.
- Seven hells.

622
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:56,300
When you're old enough,

623
00:44:56,334 --> 00:44:59,036
I'll make you a match
with someone who's worthy of you,

624
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,739
someone who's brave
and gentle and strong--

625
00:45:01,773 --> 00:45:05,043
I don't want someone brave
and gentle and strong. I want him!

626
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,846
He'll be the greatest
King that ever was, a golden lion,

627
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,648
and I'll give him
sons with beautiful blond hair.

628

Arya: <i>The lion'sot</i>
<i>s Sigil, idiot.</i>

629
00:45:13,352 --> 00:45:15,153
He's a stag,
like his father.

630
00:45:15,187 --> 00:45:18,089
He is not.
He's nothing like that old drunk King.

631
00:45:21,293 --> 00:45:24,129
Go on, girls. Get your Septa and start
packing your things.

632
00:45:24,163 --> 00:45:25,665
- Wait!
- Come on.

633
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,333
