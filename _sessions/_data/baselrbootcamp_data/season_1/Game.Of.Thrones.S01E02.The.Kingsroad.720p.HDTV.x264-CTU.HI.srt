<i>Jon Arryn is dead.</i>

<i>has two brothers?</i>

There's the pretty one,
and there's the clever one.

8
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:21,870
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

9
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:23,639
We were meant
to rule together.

<i>I have a son, you have a daughter.</i>
<i>We'll join our houses.</i>

The boy I beheaded--
he was talking madness.

Said the others
slaughtered his friends.

- Maybe.

You're Tyrion Lannister.

You-- you're Ned Stark's

Let me give you
some advice, bastard.

17

Never forget what you are and it
can never be used to hurt you.

18
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:46,389
It's a direwolf.

19
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,136
There are no direwolves
south of the wall.

20
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,066
Now there are five, one for
each of the Stark children.

21
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:53,168
- What about you?
- I'm not a Stark.

<i>and his sister Daenerys?</i>

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,582
I don't want to be his queen.
I want to go home.

<i>with Khal Drogo's army.</i>

28
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:13,075
From your sister.

29
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,092
She says Jon Arryn was
murdered by the Lannisters.

30
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:18,427
She says the King
is in danger.

31
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,295
What if Jon Arryn
told someone?

32
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,398
Whatever Jon Arryn knew
died with him.

But first you will get
to Lord and Lady Stark

89
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:25,633
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,502
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

It's no mercy, letting a child

Only the gods

00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:13,640
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

118
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,778

dressed, your Grace.

Handsome one, isn't he?

137
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,164
I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

138
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:47,301
He was a fighter too--

139
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:50,671
tried to beat the fever
that took him.

140

Forgive me.

141
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:55,008
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

It was years ago.

Robert was crazed, beat
his hands bloody on the wall,

145
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:07,588
all the things men do to show
you how much they care.

146

The boy looked
just like him.

147
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:19,032
Such a little thing...

148
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,935
A bird without feathers.

149
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:28,942
They came to take his body away
and Robert held me.

150
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:31,076
I screamed and I battled,
but he held me.

151

That little bundle.

152
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:42,589
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

153
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:44,958
Never have visited
the crypt, never.

154

I pray to the mother
every morning and night

00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,873
that she return
your child to you.

Perhaps this time
she'll listen.

00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,047
<i>( Bellows pumping )</i>

159
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,733
A sword for the wall?

160
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:04,471
- I already have one.
- Good man.

161
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:07,708
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course I have.

162
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:09,376
At someone, I mean.

163
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:17,050
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

164
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:20,253
You realize we're nothing
but sacks of meat

165
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:23,724
and blood and some bone
to keep it all standing.

166
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:28,095
Let me thank you
ahead of time

167
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,964
for guarding us all from
the perils beyond the wall--

168
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,600
Wildlings and White Walkers
and whatnot.

169
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:37,371
We're grateful to have

170
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:39,773
good, strong men like you
protecting us.

171
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,078
We've guarded the kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

172
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:50,283
Is it "we" already?

173
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,487
Have you taken
your vows then?

174
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:54,788
Soon enough.

175
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:59,359
Give my regards
to The Night's Watch.

176
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:02,829
I'm sure it will be thrilling
to serve in such an elite force.

177
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:04,798
And if not?

178
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:07,701
It's only for life.

179
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:28,455
Thank you, Nymeria.

180
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:38,131
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

181
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,801
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

182
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:42,574
Who cares how they're folded?!

183
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:44,000
They're going to get all
messed up anyway.

184
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:46,373
It's good
you've got help.

185
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:48,208
Watch.

186
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:50,143
Nymeria, gloves.

187
00:14:52,914 --> 00:14:54,815
( Whimpers )

188
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,251
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

189
00:14:58,286 --> 00:15:00,887
Nymeria, gloves!

190
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:04,758
I have something for you.

191
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,127
And it has to be packed
very carefully.

192
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:08,962
A present?

193
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:11,098
Close the door.

194
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:25,946
This is no toy.

195
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,451
Be careful you don't
cut yourself.

196
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,356
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

197
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:39,459
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

198
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:40,961
<i>It won't hack</i>
<i>a man's head off,</i>

199
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:43,130
but it can poke him full
of holes if you're quick enough.

200
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:44,201
I can be quick.

201
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:45,922
You'll have to work
at it every day.

202
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,535
How does it feel?

203
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:51,238
Do you like
the balance?

204
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:53,440
I think so.

205
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:57,277
First lesson: Stick them
with the pointy end.

206
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:59,346
I know which end to use.

207
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:06,887
I'm going to miss you.

208
00:16:08,456 --> 00:16:09,890
Careful.

209
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:24,037
All the best swords
have names, you know.

210
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:29,409
Sansa can keep
her sewing needles.

211
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:33,013
I've got a needle
of my own.

212
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:49,830
I came to say
goodbye to Bran.

213
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:51,598
You've said it.

214
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,345
I wish I could be here
when you wake up.

215
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:10,851
I'm going north
with Uncle Benjen.

216
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:12,652
I'm taking the black.

217
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:24,297
I know we always talked about
seeing the wall together,

218
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:28,201
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

219
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:32,372
I'll know my way
around by then.

220
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:35,175
I'll be a sworn brother
of The Night's Watch.

221
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:43,283
We can go out walking beyond the wall,
if you're not afraid.

222
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:00,133
I want you

223
00:18:00,201 --> 00:18:01,801
to leave.

224
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:04,297
17 years ago

225
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:06,499
you rode off
with Robert Baratheon.

226
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:12,038
You came back a year later with
another woman's son.

227
00:19:13,507 --> 00:19:16,209
And now
you're leaving again.

228
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:20,647
I have no choice.

229
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:24,551
That's what men always say
when honor calls.

230
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:28,154
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

231
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:32,058
You do have a choice.

232
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:34,861
And you've made it.

233
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,033
Cat--

234
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:48,408
( tearfully )
I can't do it, Ned.

235
00:19:51,379 --> 00:19:54,581
- I really can't.
- You can.

236
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:58,685
You must.

237
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:24,644
You've said
goodbye to Bran?

238
00:20:24,678 --> 00:20:27,113
He's not going to die.
I know it.

239
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:29,449
You Starks
are hard to kill.

240
00:20:30,351 --> 00:20:32,052
My mother?

241
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:34,554
- She was very kind.
- Good.

242
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,558
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

243
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:40,760
It was always my color.

244
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:45,098
- Farewell, Snow.
- And you, Stark.

245
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:40,086
There's great honor serving
in The Night's Watch.

246
00:21:42,123 --> 00:21:45,558
<i>The Starks have manned the wall</i>
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

247
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:48,561
And you are a Stark.

248
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:50,830
You might not have my name,

249
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:52,999
but you have my blood.

250
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,741
Is my mother alive?

251
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:04,978
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

252
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,681
Does she care?

253
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,152
The next time
we see each other,

254
00:22:12,186 --> 00:22:14,521
we'll talk
about your mother.

255
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:16,422
Huh?

256
00:22:16,457 --> 00:22:18,525
I promise.

257
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,059
( Horse neighs )

258
00:22:58,132 --> 00:23:01,134
Gods, this is country!

259
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:06,472
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

260
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:10,910
I've half a mind
to go with you.

261
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:12,979
What do you say,
just you and me

262
00:23:13,013 --> 00:23:15,548
on the Kingsroad,
swords at our sides,

263
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:19,152
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

264
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:21,854
You should have
asked me 20 years ago.

265
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:24,757
There were wars to fight,
women to marry--

266
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,859
we never had the chance
to be young.

267
00:23:26,894 --> 00:23:28,895
I recall
a few chances.

268
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,231
( Laughing )

269
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:35,435
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

270
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:37,437
That common girl of yours?

271
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:40,273
Becca? With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

272
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:42,642
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

273
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:46,312
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie

274
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:49,182
and her tits.

275
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,618
Yours was... Aleena?

276
00:23:51,652 --> 00:23:54,721
No. You told me once.
Meryl?

277
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:56,789
Your bastard's mother?

278
00:23:58,425 --> 00:24:00,693
- Wylla.
- <i>That's it.</i>

279
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:02,895
<i>She must have been</i>
<i>a rare wench</i>

280
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,765
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honor.

281
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,034
You never told me
what she looked like.

282
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:10,436
Nor will I.

283
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:14,774
We were at war.

284
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:17,477
<i>None of us knew if we were</i>
<i>gonna go back home again.</i>

285
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:20,980
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

286
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:26,085
I swear if I weren't your King,
you'd have hit me already.

287
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,155
The worst thing
about your coronation--

288
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:31,758
I'll never get
to hit you again.

289
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:36,496
Trust me, that's not
the worst thing.

290
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:42,502
There was a rider
in the night.

291
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:52,078
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

292
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:54,781
What of it?
Should we send her a wedding gift?

293
00:24:54,815 --> 00:24:56,516
A knife perhaps,
a good sharp one,

294
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,484
and a bold man to wield it.

295
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:00,486
She's little more
than a child.

296
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:03,756
Soon enough that child will spread
her legs and start breeding.

297
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:07,460
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

298
00:25:07,494 --> 00:25:11,364
<i>What her father did to your family--</i>
<i>that was unspeakable.</i>

299
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:13,466
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister--

300
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,635
<i>the woman I loved.</i>

301
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:18,938
I'll kill every Targaryen
I get my hands on.

302
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:21,174
But you can't get
your hands on this one, can you?

303
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,142
This Khal Drogo,

304
00:25:23,177 --> 00:25:25,511
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

305
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:28,314
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

306
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:31,150
as long as they remain on the
other side of the Narrow Sea.

307
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:33,152
They have no ships,
Robert.

308
00:25:33,187 --> 00:25:36,356
There are still those in the
Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.

309
00:25:37,891 --> 00:25:41,160
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

310
00:25:41,195 --> 00:25:43,996
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

311
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:48,868
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

312
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,742
There's a war coming, Ned.

313
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:57,610
<i>I don't know when,</i>

314
00:25:57,644 --> 00:26:00,179
I don't know who
we'll be fighting,

315
00:26:00,214 --> 00:26:01,714
but it's coming.

316
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:07,019
( Laughter )

317
00:26:27,608 --> 00:26:29,442
( Whimpering )

318
00:26:55,436 --> 00:26:57,837
<i>( Wind whispering )</i>

319
00:27:06,346 --> 00:27:08,347
<i>( Animal cries )</i>

320
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:15,354
Sit.

321
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:17,390
You'll be fed.

322
00:27:20,694 --> 00:27:23,062
<i>Untie them.</i>

323
00:27:23,096 --> 00:27:26,566
Ah, rapers.

324
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:32,405
They were given a choice no doubt--
castration or the wall.

325
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:34,874
Most choose the knife.

326
00:27:39,513 --> 00:27:42,415
Not impressed
by your new brothers?

327
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:47,053
<i>Lovely thing</i>
<i>about the watch--</i>

328
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:50,590
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

329
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:01,434
Why do you read so much?

330
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:04,737
Look at me and tell me
what you see.

331
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:07,773
Is this a trick?

332
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:11,544
What you see is a dwarf.

333
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:15,014
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

334
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:18,851
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

335
00:28:18,886 --> 00:28:21,420
Things are expected of me.

336
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:23,890
My father was the Hand
of the King for 20 years.

337
00:28:23,924 --> 00:28:26,125
Until your brother
killed that King.

338
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:35,601
Yes, until my brother
killed him.

339
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,139
<i>Life is full of these</i>
<i>little ironies.</i>

340
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:43,309
My sister married
the new King

341
00:28:43,343 --> 00:28:46,546
and my repulsive nephew
will be King after him.

342
00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:52,451
I must do my part for the honor
of my house, wouldn't you agree?

343
00:28:54,154 --> 00:28:56,088
<i>But how?</i>

344
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:58,925
Well, my brother
has his sword

345
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,826
and I have my mind.

346
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:04,196
And a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

347
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:07,333
That's why I read
so much, Jon Snow.

348
00:29:10,671 --> 00:29:13,139
And you?

349
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:15,508
What's your story,
bastard?

350
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:20,713
Ask me nicely and maybe
I'll tell you, dwarf.

351
00:29:24,484 --> 00:29:27,453
A bastard boy
with nothing to inherit,

352
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:29,422
<i>off to join</i>

353
00:29:29,456 --> 00:29:31,924
<i>the ancient order</i>
<i>of The Night's Watch,</i>

354
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:35,928
alongside his Valiant
brothers-in-arms.

355
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:38,030
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from--

356
00:29:38,065 --> 00:29:41,300
ah, yes yes, against grumpkins
and snarks

357
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:44,770
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

358
00:29:44,805 --> 00:29:47,173
<i>You're a smart boy.</i>

359
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:49,809
You don't believe
that nonsense.

360
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,286
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

361
00:30:14,434 --> 00:30:16,702
<i>( Door creaks )</i>

362
00:30:34,688 --> 00:30:38,557
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

363
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:42,728
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

364
00:30:44,297 --> 00:30:46,899
Talk to Poole about it.

365
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:51,337
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

366
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:54,073
<i>We need a new steward,</i>

367
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:57,276
and there are several other
appointments that require

368
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,414
- our immediate attention--
- I don't care about appointments!

369
00:31:02,716 --> 00:31:04,583
Robb: I'll make the appointments.

370
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,235
We'll talk about it
first thing in the morning.

371
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,460
Very good, my Lord.

372
00:31:13,694 --> 00:31:15,327
My Lady.

373
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,438
<i>( Distant barking,</i>
<i>howling )</i>

374
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,409
When was the last time
you left this room?

375
00:31:30,444 --> 00:31:33,079
I have to take care
of him.

376
00:31:33,113 --> 00:31:34,980
He's not going
to die, mother.

377
00:31:34,981 --> 00:31:37,192
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

378
00:31:37,193 --> 00:31:38,559
<i>What if he's wrong?</i>

379
00:31:38,655 --> 00:31:42,359
- Bran needs me.
- <i>Rickon needs you.</i>

380
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:44,356
- He's six.
- <i>( Howling continues )</i>

381
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:47,793
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

382
00:31:47,828 --> 00:31:50,262
- clutching my leg, crying--
- close the windows!

383
00:31:50,297 --> 00:31:52,465
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

384
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:58,671
Fire.

385
00:31:58,705 --> 00:32:00,873
You stay here.
I'll come back.

386

<i>( Barking, people clamoring )</i>

388
00:32:18,592 --> 00:32:21,093
You're not supposed
to be here.

389
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:23,829
No one is
supposed to be here.

390
00:32:23,897 --> 00:32:27,466
It's a mercy.
He's dead already.

391
00:32:30,137 --> 00:32:32,838
No!
( Yelps )

392
00:32:41,114 --> 00:32:43,315
( Shouting )

393
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:52,858
- ( Snarling )
- ( Screaming )

394

<i>( Horses whinny )</i>

<i>( People chatter,</i>
<i>child cries )</i>

397
00:33:38,572 --> 00:33:42,341
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

398
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:45,411
<i>Everywhere?</i>
<i>Even in the east?</i>

399
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:48,380
<i>No dragon.</i>
<i>Brave men kill them.</i>

400
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:51,617
- <i>It is known.</i>
- It is known.

401
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:55,688
A trader from Garth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

402
00:33:55,722 --> 00:33:58,057
The moon?

403
00:33:58,124 --> 00:34:00,292
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

404
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:03,362
<i>that once there were</i>
<i>two moons in the sky.</i>

405
00:34:03,396 --> 00:34:07,233
But one wandered too close
to the sun and it cracked from the heat.

406
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:10,502
Out of it poured a thousand
thousand dragons

407
00:34:10,537 --> 00:34:12,471
and they drank
the sun's fire.

408
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:15,407
( Giggles )
Moon is no egg.

409
00:34:15,442 --> 00:34:18,277
Moon is goddess--
wife of sun.

410
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:21,080
- It is known.
- It is known.

411
00:34:22,616 --> 00:34:24,583
Leave me with her.

412
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:35,694
Why did the trader from Garth
tell you these stories?

413
00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:38,931
Men like to talk
when they're happy.

414
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:41,000
Before your brother
bought me for you,

415
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:43,102
it was my job
to make men happy.

416
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:46,338
- How old were you?
- I was nine

417
00:34:46,373 --> 00:34:48,374
when my mother sold me
to the pleasure house.

418
00:34:48,408 --> 00:34:49,909
Nine?!

419
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:53,379
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

420
00:34:53,413 --> 00:34:54,947
First

421
00:34:54,981 --> 00:34:56,949
you must learn.

422
00:34:59,786 --> 00:35:03,289
Can you teach me how
to make the Khal happy?

423
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:08,394
- Yes.
- Will it take three years?

424
00:35:09,796 --> 00:35:11,463
No.

425
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,942
<i>( Wind whispering )</i>

426
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:35,120
Welcome.

427
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:09,081
Catelyn: What I am about to tell
you must remain between us.

428
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:13,218
I don't think Bran
fell from that tower.

429
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:16,422
I think he was thrown.

430
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:20,526
The boy was always
sure-footed before.

431
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,295
Someone tried
to kill him twice.

432
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:26,432
<i>Why?</i>
<i>Why murder an innocent child?</i>

433
00:37:26,466 --> 00:37:29,201
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

434
00:37:29,235 --> 00:37:31,937
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

435
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:35,741
<i>But I would stake my life</i>
<i>the Lannisters are involved.</i>

436
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:39,211
We already have reason
to suspect their loyalty to the crown.

437
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:41,547
Did you notice the dagger
the killer used?

438
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:44,016
It's too fine a weapon
for such a man.

439
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,352
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

440
00:37:47,387 --> 00:37:49,288
Someone gave it to him.

441
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,226
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

442
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,481
If it's war they want--

443
00:37:56,506 --> 00:37:58,194
If it comes to that, you know
I'll stand behind you.

444
00:37:58,198 --> 00:38:01,066
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

445
00:38:01,101 --> 00:38:03,068
<i>Huh?</i>

446
00:38:03,103 --> 00:38:06,071
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

447
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:08,140
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>the truth yet.</i>

448
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:10,742
Lord Stark
must be told of this.

449
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:13,712
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

450
00:38:13,746 --> 00:38:15,647
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

451
00:38:15,682 --> 00:38:18,984
There must always be
a Stark in Winterfell.

452
00:38:19,018 --> 00:38:21,320
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

453
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:23,522
I must.

454
00:38:23,556 --> 00:38:26,258
I'll send hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

455
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:28,794
Too large a party attracts
unwanted attention.

456
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:31,130
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

457
00:38:31,164 --> 00:38:32,998
Let me accompany you
at least.

458
00:38:33,032 --> 00:38:35,934
<i>The Kingsroad can be a</i>
<i>dangerous place for a woman alone.</i>

459
00:38:39,672 --> 00:38:42,007
What about Bran?

460
00:38:43,543 --> 00:38:46,645
I have prayed to the seven
for more than a month.

461
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:51,183
<i>Bran's life is</i>
<i>in their hands now.</i>

462
00:39:49,876 --> 00:39:52,144
No, Khaleesi.

463
00:39:52,178 --> 00:39:54,980
You must look
in his eyes always.

464
00:39:55,014 --> 00:39:57,049
Love comes in at the eyes.

465
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:01,520
It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

466
00:40:01,554 --> 00:40:03,589
with nothing
but her eyes.

467
00:40:03,623 --> 00:40:05,924
Finish a man?

468
00:40:07,427 --> 00:40:09,528
Oh.

469
00:40:09,562 --> 00:40:14,099
Kings traveled across
the world for a night with Irogenia.

470
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:16,768
Magisters sold
their palaces.

471
00:40:16,803 --> 00:40:20,539
<i>Khals burned her enemies</i>
<i>just to have her for a few hours.</i>

472
00:40:20,573 --> 00:40:24,343
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

473
00:40:24,377 --> 00:40:27,212
and she refused them all.

474
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:30,816
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

475
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,784
I-- I don't think

476
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:35,087
that Drogo will like it
with me on top.

477
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:37,623
You will make him
like it, Khaleesi.

478
00:40:37,657 --> 00:40:39,891
Men want what
they've never had.

479
00:40:39,926 --> 00:40:43,128
And the Dothraki take slaves
like a hound takes a bitch.

480
00:40:43,162 --> 00:40:46,632
Are you a slave,
Khaleesi?

481
00:40:57,243 --> 00:41:00,112
Then don't make love
like a slave.

482
00:41:08,488 --> 00:41:10,856
( Laughs )
Very good, Khaleesi.

483
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,058
Out there
he is the mighty Khal,

484
00:41:13,092 --> 00:41:17,162
<i>but in this tent,</i>
<i>he belongs to you.</i>

485
00:41:17,196 --> 00:41:19,431
I-- I don't think

486
00:41:19,465 --> 00:41:21,533
that this is
the Dothraki way.

487
00:41:21,567 --> 00:41:24,136
If he wanted
the Dothraki way,

488
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:27,172
why did he marry you?

489
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:18,490
No.

490
00:42:20,893 --> 00:42:22,794
No!

491
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:27,499

<i>( Girls laugh )</i>

493
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,774
Pardon me, Ser.

494
00:44:19,612 --> 00:44:21,947
Do I frighten you
so much, girl?

495
00:44:23,649 --> 00:44:26,418
Or is it him there
making you shake?

496
00:44:26,452 --> 00:44:29,054
He frightens
me too.

497
00:44:29,088 --> 00:44:31,556
Look at
that face.

498
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:34,359
I'm sorry
if I offended you, Ser.

499
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:42,935
Why won't he speak to me?

500
00:44:42,936 --> 00:44:45,136
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

501
00:44:45,137 --> 00:44:48,206
Since the mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

502
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:50,976
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

503
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,779
Ser Ilyn Payne,
the King's justice.

504
00:44:56,282 --> 00:44:58,416
The royal
executioner.

505
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:02,888
What is it, sweet lady?

506
00:45:04,457 --> 00:45:06,525
Does the hound frighten you?

507
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,260
Away with you, dog.

508
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:10,962
You're scaring
my lady.

509
00:45:13,165 --> 00:45:15,300
I don't like
to see you upset.

510
00:45:17,803 --> 00:45:19,604
The Sun is finally shining.

511
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:21,406
Come walk with me.

512
00:45:23,342 --> 00:45:25,477
Stay, lady.

513
00:45:30,383 --> 00:45:32,083

( Laughing )

515
00:45:42,128 --> 00:45:44,329
I probably shouldn't
have any more.

516
00:45:44,363 --> 00:45:46,731
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

517
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:49,834
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

<i>( Sticks clacking )</i>

Don't worry--
you're safe with me.

520
00:46:06,018 --> 00:46:08,119
- I'll get you!
- ( Laughing )

521

- Arya!
- Ow!

522
00:46:16,262 --> 00:46:17,829
What are you doing here?

523
00:46:17,863 --> 00:46:20,332
- Go away.
- Your sister?

524
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,871
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my Lord.

525
00:46:26,906 --> 00:46:29,007
- He the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

526
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:32,510
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a Knight, eh?

527
00:46:34,113 --> 00:46:36,948
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

528
00:46:36,983 --> 00:46:39,584
She asked me to, my Lord.
She asked me to.

529
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:41,586
I'm your prince,

530

not your lord,

531
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:47,192
and I said pick up
your sword.

532
00:46:47,259 --> 00:46:49,594
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

533
00:46:49,629 --> 00:46:51,496
And you're not a Knight.

534
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:55,066
Only a butcher's boy.

535
00:46:55,101 --> 00:46:58,136
That was my lady's sister
you were hitting, do you know that?

536
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,505
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

537
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,208
I won't hurt him...

538
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:04,843
Much.

No no, stop it, stop it,
both of you.

You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

How dare you speak
to your King in that manner?

Quiet, woman.

588

Sorry, Ned.
I never meant to frighten the girl.

But we need to get
this business done quickly.

Your girl and that butcher's boy

Bit him a little.

- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

Yes it is!

598
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:36,219
They all attacked me and she
threw my sword in the river.

Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

603

Where's your
other daughter, Ned?

Now, child...

609

Tell me what happened.

610
00:51:09,855 --> 00:51:11,923
Tell it all
and tell it true.

611
00:51:11,957 --> 00:51:14,592
It's a great crime
to lie to a King.

612
00:51:23,002 --> 00:51:24,936
I don't know.

613
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:28,406
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

614
00:51:29,308 --> 00:51:31,776
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar liar liar!

617
00:51:35,648 --> 00:51:40,009
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

<i>I want her punished.</i>

619
00:51:41,108 --> 00:51:43,840
What would you have me do,
whip her through the streets?

620
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:47,064
Damn it, children fight.
It's over.

621
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,702
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

622
00:51:51,371 --> 00:51:55,007
( Scornfully ) You let that
little girl disarm you?

623
00:52:01,014 --> 00:52:04,150
Ned, see to it that
your daughter is disciplined.

624
00:52:04,184 --> 00:52:07,053
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, your Grace.

625
00:52:08,288 --> 00:52:10,923
Cersei:
And what of the direwolf?

626
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:13,559
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

627
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,931
I'd forgot
the damned wolf.

628
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:21,734
We found no trace
of the direwolf, your Grace.

629
00:52:21,768 --> 00:52:25,037
No?
So be it.

630
00:52:25,072 --> 00:52:27,240
We have another wolf.

631
00:52:30,544 --> 00:52:32,178
As you will.

632
00:52:32,212 --> 00:52:35,414
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.

633
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:37,884
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

634
00:52:39,019 --> 00:52:41,387
He doesn't mean Lady,
does he?

635
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:44,423
No no, not lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

636
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:46,359
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

637
00:52:46,393 --> 00:52:49,762
- <i>You leave her alone!</i>
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

638
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:52,565
Please please,
it wasn't Lady!

639
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:54,100
Is this your command--

640
00:52:55,168 --> 00:52:56,702
your Grace?

641

<i>( Door slams )</i>

642
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,646
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, your Grace.

643
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,848
Ser Ilyn,
do me the honor.

644
00:53:08,882 --> 00:53:11,183
No.

645
00:53:11,218 --> 00:53:13,586
Jory...

646
00:53:14,688 --> 00:53:16,722
Take the girls
to their rooms.

- If it must be done,

649
00:53:23,563 --> 00:53:25,531
then I'll do it myself.

650
00:53:25,565 --> 00:53:27,767
Is this some trick?

651
00:53:27,801 --> 00:53:30,736
The wolf is of the north.

652
00:53:30,771 --> 00:53:33,873
She deserves better
than a butcher.

653
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,175
The butcher's boy--

654
00:54:09,242 --> 00:54:10,910
you rode him down?

655
00:54:10,944 --> 00:54:13,079
He ran...

656
00:54:13,113 --> 00:54:14,814
Not very fast.
