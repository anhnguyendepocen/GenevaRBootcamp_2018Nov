1
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:04,426
My son Jorah,
fled Westeros.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,582
He brought dishonor
to our House.

3
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,557
I need to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

4
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:11,076
into men
of The Night's Watch.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,036
And how's that going,
commander Mormont?

6
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:15,685
I shall have
your head for this!

7
00:00:18,738 --> 00:00:20,692
You're taking us
through Valyria.

8
00:00:20,874 --> 00:00:23,001
The Doom
still rules Valyria.

9
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,831
Stone Men!

10
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:33,057
Don't let them
touch you!

11
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:35,140
You?

12
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:39,890
The Eyrie is mine.

13
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,308
The last time
the lords of the Eyrie

14
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:44,421
formed an alliance
with the lords of the North,

15
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:47,284
they brought down the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,276
Cersei sent for me.

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,165
I expect I'll be a married woman
by the time you return.

18
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:56,252
I hope I can
make her happy.

19
00:00:56,276 --> 00:00:57,378
She's suffered enough.

20
00:00:57,402 --> 00:00:59,040
I'll never hurt her.

21
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:01,856
All sinners are equal
before the gods.

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,715
What would you say if I told you
of a great sinner in our very midst?

23
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:08,528
May the Father
judge him justly.

24
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:09,782
Who do you
think you are?

25
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:11,260
Justice.

26
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:13,107
Your brother was murdered

27
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:15,854
while you sit here
doing nothing.

28
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:17,335
The Sand Snakes are with me.

29
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,139
Without Doran, we have no
army to march against the Lannisters.

30
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,847
<i>Queen Cersei loves</i>
<i>her children.</i>

31
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:24,115
And we have one of them.

32
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:26,934
We're rescuing my niece,
bringing her back to her family.

33
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,442
You ever been to Dorne?

34
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:33,093
The Dornish are crazy.

35
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:34,876
If he gets to her
before we do,

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,011
we lose our only chance
for revenge.

37
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,802
Here we serve
the Many-Faced God.

38
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:42,021
To serve well,

39
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:43,802
a girl must become
no one.

40
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:45,730
What do we do with them
after we wash them?

Get back to work.

48
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:47,138
No. I've been here
for weeks.

49
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,639
I'm not scrubbing
one more corpse

50
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:51,175
until you tell me
why I'm doing it.

51
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,110
You will know why.

52

- When?
- When it's time, not before.

53

Get back to work.

54
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,418
When do I get
to play the game?

55
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:02,086
Game?

56
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,722
The game.
The Game of Faces.

57
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:08,159
You tried already.
You failed.

58
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:09,593
I didn't even know
I was playing.

59
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:12,029
Who are you?

60
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:13,697
No one.

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,233
Get back to work.

62
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:17,735
Who are you?

63
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:21,005
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

64
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,543
I'm from Westeros
just like you.

65
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:29,313
Daughter of a lord
just like you.

66
00:06:30,415 --> 00:06:32,149
Except I was
an only child.

67
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,386
Heir to his fortune.

68
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,988
My mother died.

69
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,257
My father remarried
and his new wife

70
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,160
gave birth to a girl.

71
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:47,731
My stepmother didn't want any rivals
for her precious daughter,

72
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,800
so she tried
to kill me with poison.

73
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:52,069
I found out.

74
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:54,338
Sought help from
the Faceless Men.

75
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,243
And my father
was widowed again.

76
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:03,280
I've been serving them
ever since.

77
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:17,761
Was that true
or a lie?

78
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:21,932
What?

79
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,767
Did you believe
every word I said?

80
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:30,174
Get back to work.

81
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,824
<i>Who are you?</i>

82
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:58,402
Who are you?

83
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,842
Arya.

84
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:08,145
And where did you
come from?

85
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:09,647
<i>Westeros.</i>

86
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,753
My family home
is Winterfell.

87
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,422
I'm the youngest daughter
of a great lord,

88
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:19,590
Eddard Stark.

89
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:21,698
He died in battle.

90
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,928
A lie.

91
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,997
After he was executed,
I fled the capital.

92
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,267
Had to kill a stable boy.

93
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,069
Drove my sword
through his back.

94
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:35,206
A lie.

95
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,174
I stabbed him
in the gut.

96
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:39,743
<i>I tried to find</i>
<i>my mother and brother,</i>

97
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:41,412
<i>but I never did.</i>

98
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,847
<i>They were murdered</i>
<i>by Walder Frey.</i>

99
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:47,484
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called Polliver.

100
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:52,923
A man called the Hound.
Sandor Clegane.

101
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,059
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

102
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:57,094
He begged me to kill him,
but I wouldn't.

103
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:59,230
I left him
in the mountains to die.

104
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:01,732
I wanted him to suffer.
I hated him.

105
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,302
I hated him.

106
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:09,740
That's not a lie!

107
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:12,776
A girl lies to me,

108
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:16,247
to the Many-Faced God,
to herself.

109
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:18,449
Does she truly
want to be no one?

110
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,684
Yes.

111
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:28,692
I'm not playing
this stupid game anymore!

112
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:30,894
We never stop playing.

113
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:56,820
So, those villages
we were supposed to find?

114
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:58,689
We can't live on
berries and roots.

115
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,425
I can.

116
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:03,260
You're not hungry?

117
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:05,562
Of course
I'm hungry.

118
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:08,132
You're an awful travelling companion,
do you know that?

119
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,401
Possibly the least
charming man I've ever met.

120
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,069
I'm not your travelling
companion.

121
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:15,406
We are travelling together
in each other's company, therefore--

122
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:17,341
Do you ever shut up?

123
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:20,911
I sailed from King's Landing
to Pentos in a crate

124
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:23,413
<i>without ever</i>
<i>saying a word.</i>

125
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,148
Why?

126
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,254
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

127
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:35,525
You never wondered
why Tyrion Lannister

128
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,261
decided to visit
a brothel in Volantis?

129
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:41,264
I'm sure you visited many brothels
in many cities.

130
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,068
I killed my father.

131
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:50,974
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

132
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:55,846
And he was fucking
the woman I loved.

133
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:08,024
As miserable
as you are, Mormont,

134
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:09,593
at least your father
was a good man.

135
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,428
What do you know
about my father?

136
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,031
I met him.
I visited the Wall.

137
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:18,001
When I asked him
about his men,

138
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:20,237
he knew all their stories,
every one of them.

139
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:23,874
He actually cared about the people
under his command.

140
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:27,310
How do they put it
in the Watch?

141
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:30,080
"We shall never see
his like again."

142
00:11:39,757 --> 00:11:43,260
Oh, you didn't know.

143
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,635
I'm sorry.
I am.

144
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,472
How?

145
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,842
I only know
what I heard.

146
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:00,043
How?

147
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:02,646
<i>He was leading</i>
<i>an expedition beyond the Wall.</i>

148
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:06,249
There was a mutiny.

149
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:08,552
He was murdered
by his own men.

150
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:22,432
We better keep moving.

151
00:13:11,883 --> 00:13:13,450
Valar morghulis.

152
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:15,585
Valar dohaeris.

153
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:19,322
I have nowhere
else to go.

154
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:23,026
I've taken her
to every healer in Braavos.

155
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,029
I've spent
every penny I had.

156
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:34,170
She suffers every day
of her life.

157
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:37,173
I just want it to end.

158
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:06,770
It hurts.

159
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,172
I know.

160
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:13,743
Don't be afraid.

161
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:17,180
I used to be like you.

162
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:19,349
I was sick.

163
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:22,619
I was dying.

164
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:29,159
But my father
never gave up on me.

165
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:34,364
He loved me

166
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:35,999
more than anything
in the world,

167
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:38,768
just like your father
loves you.

168
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:42,072
So he brought me here.

169
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:44,774
My father prayed
to the Many-Faced God.

170
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:49,012
And I drank the water
from his fountain.

171
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:52,148
It healed me.

172
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:07,364
I've devoted my life
to him now.

173
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,900
You don't want
to hurt anymore?

174
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:14,838
Drink.

175
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:01,104
<i>Is a girl ready?</i>

176
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:05,642
To give up her ears,
her nose, her tongue?

177
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,113
<i>Her hopes and dreams,</i>
<i>her loves and hates?</i>

178
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:12,949
All that makes a girl
who she is?

179
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,219
Forever?

180
00:18:19,356 --> 00:18:21,758
No.

181
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:24,928
A girl is not ready
to become no one.

182
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:33,102
But she is ready
to become someone else.

183
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:49,419
Why Daenerys?
Why is she worth all this?

184
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:54,257
As I recall, the Mormonts fought
against the Targaryens

185
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,192
during Robert's
Rebellion.

186
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:58,361
Do you believe
in anything?

187
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:00,063
I believe
in lots of things.

188
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,031
In something greater
than ourselves, I mean.

189
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:04,167
The gods, destiny.

190
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:07,403
Do you believe there's
a plan for this world?

191
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:09,906
No.

192
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,207
Neither did I.

193
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:13,610
I was a cynic
just like you.

194
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:16,779
Then I saw a girl
step into a great fire

195
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:18,715
with three stone eggs.

196
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:21,551
When the fire burned out,
I thought I'd find her blackened bones.

197
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:25,688
Instead, I saw her,
Daenerys,

198
00:19:25,723 --> 00:19:29,726
alive and unhurt,
holding her baby dragons.

199
00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:34,831
Have you ever heard
baby dragons singing?

200
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:36,599
No.

201
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,102
It's hard to be
a cynic after that.

202
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,273
Doesn't mean she's going
to be a great queen.

203
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,208
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

204
00:19:45,242 --> 00:19:47,510
The Targaryens
are famously insane.

205
00:19:47,544 --> 00:19:50,446
What if she conquers the world?
Then what?

206
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,749
1,000 years of peace
and prosperity?

207
00:19:52,783 --> 00:19:54,784
First we have
to conquer the world.

208
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,686
We?

209
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,921
All right, let's assume
your dreams come true.

210
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,292
<i>She's ecstatic when you</i>
<i>bring her this enemy dwarf.</i>

211
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,495
<i>She hacks off my head</i>
<i>and restores your position.</i>

212
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,830
You command her army,
sail to Westeros,

213
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:10,800
defeat all your enemies
and watch her climb those steps

214
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,302
and sit on
the Iron Throne.

215
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,604
Hurrah.
Long live the queen. Then what?

216
00:20:14,638 --> 00:20:16,239
Then she rules.

217
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:19,442
So a woman who has not
spent a single day of her adult life

218
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:22,178
in Westeros becomes
the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?

219
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:24,781
- She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

220
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:28,651
Because her father, who burned living men
for amusement, was the king?

221
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,324
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

222
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,159
They probably
came ashore for--

223
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,661
<i>Water.</i>

224
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:52,008
Got a lot of fight
in you, huh?

225
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,318
Salt mines?

226
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,621
Yeah, that
or a galley slave.

227
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:07,523
<i>He looks strong enough.</i>

228
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,360
What about the dwarf?

229
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,695
Worthless.

230
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,331
Cut his throat.

231
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:17,367
Wait. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait! Let's discuss this.

232
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,836
And then chop off
his cock.

233
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,104
We'll sell it
for a fortune.

234
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:23,272
A dwarf's cock
has magic powers.

235
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:25,675
Wait! Wait!

236
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:27,076
Wait, wait, wait!

237
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:29,712
You can't just hand
a dry cock to a merchant

238
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,247
and expect him
to pay for it.

239
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:33,282
He has to know
it came from a dwarf.

240
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:36,619
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

241
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:38,388
It will be
a dwarf-sized cock.

242
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,423
Guess again.

243
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:48,364
The dwarf lives
until we find a cock merchant.

244
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,542
Queen Daenerys
has outlawed slavery.

245
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:02,612
We're bound for Volantis,
not Slaver's Bay.

246
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:06,349
Besides, she reopened
the fighting pits.

247
00:22:06,383 --> 00:22:09,051
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

248
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:11,287
<i>The fighting pits</i>
<i>in Meereen?</i>

249
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:14,290
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

250
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:18,261
You are looking at one of the
great warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.

251
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,564
Him.

252
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:25,535
Him?
He's got to be 60 years old.

253
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:28,271
Sure, he's a bit
long in the tooth,

254
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,107
a bit withered,
been in the sun too long.

255
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,610
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

256
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,946
They wrote songs
about him.

257
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,887
That true?

258
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:53,062
He won the tournament
at Lannisport.

259
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:55,731
Unseating Ser Jaime
Lannister himself.

260
00:22:56,967 --> 00:23:00,002
The Kingslayer.

261
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:03,439
Jousting.
You're talking about jousting.

262
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:05,808
A fancy game
for fancy lads.

263
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,611
The men who fight in the pits of Meereen
will swallow him whole.

264
00:23:08,645 --> 00:23:11,481
I killed a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

265
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,626
Liar.

266
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,329
It's no lie.
His name was Qotho.

267
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,265
He was bloodrider
to Khal Drogo.

268
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:33,269
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

269
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:34,937
I'll prove my worth.

270
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,852
For my children.
Money.

271
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,525
Lord Baelish.

272
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,693
Yes?

273
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:01,097
Lancel Lannister.

274
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:05,201
Brother Lancel.

275
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,836
We abandon
our family names.

276
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,671
Quite a family
to abandon.

277
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:11,874
The city has changed
since you were here last.

278
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,809
We flooded the gutters
with wine,

279
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:16,312
smashed the false idols,

280
00:24:16,346 --> 00:24:18,848
and set the godless
on the run.

281
00:24:18,882 --> 00:24:20,383
Well done.

282
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,058
I'm here on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

283
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:32,061
Should I send word
that I'll be delayed?

284
00:24:35,832 --> 00:24:37,500
Step carefully,
Lord Baelish.

285
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:39,969
You'll find there's little
tolerance for flesh peddlers

286
00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:41,537
in the new King's Landing.

287
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:44,407
We both peddle fantasies,
Brother Lancel.

288
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:46,943
Mine just happen
to be entertaining.

289
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:59,589
Do you think it's wise,
Your Grace,

290
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,424
arresting the heir
to Highgarden?

291
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,293
The Faith arrested
the heir to Highgarden.

292
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:07,430
Of course, and the Faith were
armed on your orders.

293
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:09,265
The king's orders.

294
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,400
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras's perversion?

295
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,336
House Tyrell
won't tolerate this insult.

296
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,505
House Tyrell
won't tolerate it?

297
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,474
I'm the insulted party,
Lord Baelish.

298
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:20,343
Ser Loras
was promised to me.

299
00:25:20,377 --> 00:25:22,378
Instead he chose
the company of boys.

300
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:24,680
One's choice of companion
is a curious thing.

301
00:25:27,384 --> 00:25:28,951
Most curious.

302
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,289
Lysa Arryn,
for instance.

303
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,324
Thoroughly
repellant woman.

304
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:38,694
Forgive me.

305
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:40,696
I know you're still
in mourning.

306
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:44,066
Lysa was a good woman.

307
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:45,401
A kind woman.

308
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:48,404
<i>She was neither</i>
<i>of those things. We both know it.</i>

309
00:25:48,438 --> 00:25:50,439
Still, I pity her son.

310
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:52,742
How fortunate
the young Lord of the Vale

311
00:25:52,776 --> 00:25:55,077
<i>has a new father</i>
<i>to counsel him.</i>

312
00:25:55,112 --> 00:25:57,113
I know how hard
it can be

313
00:25:57,147 --> 00:25:59,949
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

314
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:03,023
If war comes to Westeros, will the
Knights of the Vale  fight for their king?

315
00:26:04,054 --> 00:26:06,389
Young Lord Robin
heeds my advice.

316
00:26:07,924 --> 00:26:10,326
And I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

317
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,161
Good.

318
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:18,367
If there's
nothing else.

319
00:26:19,503 --> 00:26:21,337
There is another matter,
Your Grace.

320
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,073
Something so urgent
I couldn't trust the words to a raven.

321
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:27,009
You once charged me
with finding Arya Stark.

322
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,945
To my shame,
I failed you.

323
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,281
But I have found
Sansa Stark.

324
00:26:33,817 --> 00:26:37,219
Alive and well
and home again

325
00:26:37,254 --> 00:26:38,721
living at Winterfell.

326
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:41,023
That's not possible.

327
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,392
My sources
are well placed.

328
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,595
They tell me Roose Bolton

329
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,098
plans to marry her
to his son Ramsay,

330
00:26:49,132 --> 00:26:51,801
a bastard recently
legitimized by King Tommen.

331
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:55,805
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North
by the grace of my father.

332
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,809
Indeed, his reward
for stabbing his own king in the heart.

333
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:03,245
We were fools
to trust a turncloak.

334
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,681
Marrying his son
to the last of the Starks

335
00:27:05,716 --> 00:27:07,616
gives him more legitimacy
in the North

336
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:09,585
than an alliance with
a hated southern house.

337
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:12,988
I will skin him
and his bastard

338
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:14,857
like that wretch
on their bloody Sigil.

339
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:16,692
I would counsel patience,
Your Grace.

340
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:18,594
Patience?

341
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:20,162
Sansa helped
murder my son.

342
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,764
Roose Bolton
is a traitor.

343
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:23,766
Stannis Baratheon
is also a traitor,

344
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:25,401
marching with his army
on Winterfell.

345
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,937
Let Stannis
and Roose battle.

346
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:30,606
Let the enemies
of the throne slaughter each other.

347
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,976
And when they're done, seize
Winterfell from whichever thief survives.

348
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,479
Winterfell is 1,000 miles
away from here.

349
00:27:36,513 --> 00:27:38,681
The weather has already
begun to turn.

350
00:27:38,715 --> 00:27:41,617
That is why it is critical
to strike soon

351
00:27:41,651 --> 00:27:44,086
while the victor
still licks his wounds.

352
00:27:45,856 --> 00:27:48,157
Surely your Uncle Kevan
could muster a force.

353
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:51,527
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage
of a kitchen mouse.

354
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:53,162
Ser Jaime, then.

355
00:27:53,196 --> 00:27:55,798
<i>Jaime's away</i>
<i>on a sensitive diplomatic mission.</i>

356
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:58,567
I have no idea
when he'll be back.

357
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:01,036
<i>Perhaps I can help.</i>

358
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:04,240
The Knights of the Vale are some
of the best fighters in Westeros,

359
00:28:04,274 --> 00:28:06,475
trained to battle
in the ice and the snow.

360
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,411
Forgive me,
Lord Baelish,

361
00:28:09,446 --> 00:28:11,647
you have a reputation
as a moneylender

362
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:14,250
and a brothel keeper,
not a military man.

363
00:28:14,284 --> 00:28:16,418
You wouldn't risk
a single Lannister soldier

364
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:19,855
or a single coin
from the royal treasury.

365
00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:21,624
What do you have to lose?

366
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,526
A brothel keeper?

367
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,060
And if you succeed?

368
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:27,229
Name me
Warden of the North.

369
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,137
I'll speak to the king
this evening,

370
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,339
have him issue
a royal decree.

371
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:40,209
I'll not rest until the lion flies
over Winterfell.

372
00:28:40,243 --> 00:28:42,545
And I'll know
you're a man of your word

373
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:45,614
when I see Sansa Stark's
head on a spike.

374
00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:47,716
As I said...

375
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:49,718
I live to serve.

376
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:58,360
I'm going
to ask him tomorrow.

377
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,664
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

378
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:04,099
We've waited
long enough.

379
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:06,368
I want you
to be my wife.

380
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:08,470
Now.

381
00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:11,373
What is it?

382
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:14,343
Do you want to marry me
because our families arranged it?

383
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,245
Or do you--

384
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:26,288
We can't.
Not yet.

385
00:29:26,323 --> 00:29:27,523
Why not?

386
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,592
You know why not.
Someone will see.

387
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:31,994
You are going
to be my wife.

388
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:36,065
I am going to be
your husband.

389
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:39,635
We're allowed to walk through
the gardens together.

390
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:42,304
How many other girls have you
walked through these gardens?

391
00:29:44,274 --> 00:29:46,942
I like the way your eyes go squinty
when you're jealous.

392
00:29:46,977 --> 00:29:50,546
They do not go squinty
and you didn't answer the question.

393
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,015
They make
a lovely couple.

394
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:56,218
A Lannister
and a Martell.

395
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:59,655
<i>They have no idea</i>
<i>how dangerous that is.</i>

396
00:29:59,689 --> 00:30:01,891
We must protect them.

397
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,893
Yes, my prince.

398
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:08,631
You haven't had to use
that axe of yours in a long time.

399
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:11,967
I hope you remember how.

400
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:14,670
I remember how.

401
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:20,776
<i>♪ The Dornishman's wife</i>
<i>was as fair as the sun ♪</i>

402
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:25,915
♪ And her kisses
were warmer than spring ♪

403
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,883
♪ The Dornishman's
blade ♪

404
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:30,219
♪ It was made
of black steel ♪

405
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:34,723
♪ And its kiss
was a terrible thing ♪

406
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:38,961
♪ The Dornishman's wife
would sing as she bathed ♪

407
00:30:38,995 --> 00:30:43,065
- ♪ In a voice that was sweet as a peach-- ♪
- All right, that's enough.

408
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:45,200
I'm coming
to the best part.

409
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:47,202
We're trying
to blend in.

410
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:49,305
Don't want everyone
in Dorne to hear your accent.

411
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:51,140
This song really is
all about the ending.

412
00:30:51,207 --> 00:30:53,509
It can wait.
There.

413
00:30:56,913 --> 00:30:58,714
That's the Water Gardens.

414
00:30:58,748 --> 00:31:01,283
<i>And once we've got</i>
<i>the princess, then what?</i>

415
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:06,455
I like to improvise.

416
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,824
That explains
the golden hand.

417
00:31:28,311 --> 00:31:32,715
Unbowed. Unbent.
Unbroken.

418
00:31:34,284 --> 00:31:35,284
For Oberyn.

419
00:31:35,318 --> 00:31:37,286
For Oberyn.

420
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:19,094
Well, she's made
herself at home.

421
00:32:24,768 --> 00:32:27,036
Myrcella.

422
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,440
Uncle Jaime?

423
00:32:31,508 --> 00:32:33,509
I--

424
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:35,744
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

425
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,980
Let's speak in private.

426
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:40,849
- I am Trystane Martell.
- Trystane is my intended.

427
00:32:40,884 --> 00:32:43,786
Excellent.
Good to meet you.

428
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,788
We weren't expecting you,
Lord Jaime.

429
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:48,590
Why don't you let them
have some time alone, son?

430
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:55,264
Let's not do
something stupid.

431
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:01,570
That was something stupid.

432
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,138
We have to go,
Myrcella, now.

433
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:05,274
- You hurt him!
- He'll be fine, I promise.

434
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:07,042
But we have to--

435
00:33:11,014 --> 00:33:12,915
Oh, for fuck's sake.

436
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:55,991
Take her!

437
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:00,362
- You're coming with me.
- I don't want to.

438
00:34:00,396 --> 00:34:02,431
I wasn't asking,
princess.

439
00:34:09,305 --> 00:34:12,007
- Ah!
- Drop your weapons!

440
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,518
<i>I am Obara Sand.</i>

441
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:24,953
Daughter of Oberyn Martell.

442
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:28,290
I fight for Dorne.
Who do you fight for?

443
00:34:28,324 --> 00:34:30,292
Drop your weapons.

444
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:51,647
When you were whole,
it would have been a good fight.

445
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,126
You fight pretty good
for a little girl.

446
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,055
Halt!

447
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,261
Oh, you can smell the shit
from five miles away.

448
00:35:39,295 --> 00:35:41,463
Well, why have we stopped?
Go on.

449
00:35:45,368 --> 00:35:47,803
Rumors and gossip,
that's all they've got.

450
00:35:47,837 --> 00:35:49,972
It's theater,
nothing more.

451
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:53,141
If they arrested all the pillow biters
in King's Landing,

452
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:56,211
there'd be no room left in
the dungeons for anyone else.

453
00:35:56,246 --> 00:35:58,113
Everyone knew
about him and Renly.

454
00:35:58,147 --> 00:36:01,683
Renly Baratheon shagged half
the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.

455
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:03,585
Everyone knew,
no one cared.

456
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,187
But he was
the king's brother.

457
00:36:05,255 --> 00:36:07,022
And Loras
is the queen's brother.

458
00:36:07,056 --> 00:36:09,491
No, no, no, no.
This is unacceptable.

459
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:11,593
- Cersei's behind it.
- Yeah, of course she is.

460
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,029
She wants to drag our name
through the dirt,

461
00:36:14,097 --> 00:36:15,931
put us in our place.

462
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,033
Get some rest, dear.
You look appalling.

463
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:20,269
Let me deal
with Cersei Lannister.

464
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,778
Your Grace,
I have travelled a long way.

465
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,281
You must be exhausted.

466
00:36:34,617 --> 00:36:37,452
Put the pen down, dear.
We both know you're not writing anything.

467
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,822
Ah, yes. The famously tart-tongued
Queen of Thorns.

468
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,859
And the famous tart
Queen Cersei.

469
00:36:47,597 --> 00:36:49,164
I beg your pardon?

470
00:36:49,198 --> 00:36:52,801
I know you're behind
this absurd incarceration of my grandson.

471
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,671
If you apologize
for that comment, perhaps I'll--

472
00:36:55,705 --> 00:36:58,607
You'll get your apology
when I get Loras.

473
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:01,677
I was as shocked
as anyone

474
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:04,346
when the Faith
arrested Ser Loras.

475
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,982
I have no love
for these fanatics,

476
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,618
but what can
a Queen Mother do?

477
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:12,854
Has the crown
suddenly stopped needing

478
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:16,158
the troops, gold, and wheat
my house supplies?

479
00:37:16,225 --> 00:37:18,226
I can assure you,

480
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:20,295
our alliance with
House Tyrell remains--

481
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,963
Do you expect
the alliance to continue

482
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:24,700
after you've thrown
our future into prison?

483
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:27,069
As I said,

484
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:29,571
I didn't imprison anyone.

485
00:37:29,605 --> 00:37:31,006
As for your
veiled threats--

486
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,474
What veil?

487
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:39,348
The Lannister-Tyrell alliance
brought peace to a war-torn country.

488
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:42,617
Do you really want to see the
Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?

489
00:37:45,755 --> 00:37:47,289
I didn't trust
your father.

490
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:49,958
<i>I didn't</i>
<i>particularly like him.</i>

491
00:37:49,992 --> 00:37:53,528
<i>But I respected him.</i>
<i>He was no fool.</i>

492
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:57,265
He understood that sometimes
we must work with our rivals

493
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,867
rather than destroy them.

494
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,103
House Lannister
has no rival.

495
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:07,008
The High Septon has called
for an inquest, not a trial.

496
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:08,744
Just a small hearing
to determine

497
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:11,613
whether the charges
against Loras have merit,

498
00:38:11,647 --> 00:38:13,682
which I'm sure they don't.

499
00:38:13,716 --> 00:38:17,185
Loras will be freed,
our happy alliance will continue...

500
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,857
and we'll forget this unfortunate
conversation ever happened.

501
00:38:23,626 --> 00:38:25,193
Good day, Lady Olenna.

502
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:47,582
You are aware of the rumors
concerning you and Renly?

503
00:38:48,718 --> 00:38:51,286
I don't pay attention
to rumors.

504
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,656
<i>You were said</i>
<i>to be despondent when he died.</i>

505
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,226
Witnesses state that you refused
to leave his bedside

506
00:38:58,261 --> 00:39:00,796
even as Stannis's army
closed in.

507
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,666
He was my friend.
He was my king.

508
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,135
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

509
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,172
<i>He was anointed</i>
<i>by the Seven, not Renly.</i>

510
00:39:10,206 --> 00:39:14,776
I was wrong to support
Renly's claim, I know that.

511
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:18,346
But I was forgiven
by Joffrey.

512
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:20,849
I fought for him
at the Battle of Blackwater.

513
00:39:20,883 --> 00:39:24,553
Yes, wearing
Renly's armor.

514
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:26,955
Why does it matter
what I wore?

515
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,624
Do you deny all
the charges against you?

516
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,693
Fornication.

517
00:39:31,727 --> 00:39:33,895
<i>Buggery.</i>
<i>Blasphemy.</i>

518
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,530
Of course I deny them.

519
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:37,632
You never lay
with Renly Baratheon?

520
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,601
Never.

521
00:39:39,635 --> 00:39:41,803
<i>Nor any other man?</i>

522
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,438
Never.

523
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:48,443
That will be all,
Ser Loras.

524
00:39:55,585 --> 00:39:58,320
Well, I think that's
quite enough of that.

525
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,922
The Faith calls
Queen Margaery forward.

526
00:40:00,957 --> 00:40:02,924
You call me forward?

527
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:05,293
Yes, we have some
questions for you.

528
00:40:05,328 --> 00:40:09,431
- I am the queen.
- You are.

529
00:40:09,465 --> 00:40:11,900
And according
to the law of the Seven,

530
00:40:11,934 --> 00:40:14,336
neither kings
nor queens are exempt

531
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,272
from testimony
at a holy inquest.

532
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:38,927
How do you respond to these charges
against your brother?

533
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:40,695
They are lies.

534
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,397
- All of them?
- All of them.

535
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:45,400
<i>Queen Margaery,</i>

536
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:46,935
<i>in the presence</i>
<i>of the gods,</i>

537
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:49,204
do you swear
that your brother is innocent

538
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,139
of these charges
against him

539
00:40:51,173 --> 00:40:52,774
to the best
of your knowledge?

540
00:40:52,808 --> 00:40:54,876
Yes, I swear it.

541
00:40:56,145 --> 00:40:58,380
Thank you,
Your Grace.

542
00:41:23,906 --> 00:41:25,674
Do you know this man?

543
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:29,210
Yes, very well.

544
00:41:29,245 --> 00:41:31,980
<i>He is Ser Loras Tyrell,</i>
<i>heir to Highgarden.</i>

545
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:34,683
How did you
come to meet?

546
00:41:34,717 --> 00:41:37,319
<i>I squired for him.</i>

547
00:41:37,353 --> 00:41:39,187
He took a liking to me.

548
00:41:39,221 --> 00:41:41,756
He summoned me to his chamber
the first day we met.

549
00:41:43,426 --> 00:41:47,162
And what occurred
in his chamber?

550
00:41:47,196 --> 00:41:51,666
We engaged
in intimate relations.

551
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:53,535
You lay with him?

552
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:55,103
That night
and many others.

553
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,606
Liar.
He's a liar.

554
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,021
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

555
00:42:01,043 --> 00:42:03,311
Yes.

556
00:42:03,346 --> 00:42:06,247
Yes, Queen Margaery.

557
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,651
<i>She walked in on us once</i>
<i>not long ago.</i>

558
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:12,387
She didn't seem
surprised.

559
00:42:12,421 --> 00:42:16,324
This testimony is an insult
to a great house.

560
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:19,527
Why should the Faith or anyone
else take the word of a squire

561
00:42:19,562 --> 00:42:21,229
over the heir
to Highgarden?

562
00:42:21,263 --> 00:42:23,264
<i>He has a birthmark,</i>
<i>Your Grace.</i>

563
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,234
<i>Quite high on his thigh.</i>

564
00:42:26,268 --> 00:42:29,270
Wine-colored and roughly
the shape of Dorne.

565
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,840
No! Liar!

566
00:42:33,643 --> 00:42:37,545
What are you doing?
Let us pass.

567
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,081
The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

568
00:42:40,116 --> 00:42:42,017
to bring a formal trial

569
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:44,319
<i>for Ser Loras</i>

570
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,154
and Queen Margaery.

571
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,455
What?

572
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,524
Bearing false witness
before the gods

573
00:42:49,558 --> 00:42:52,193
<i>is as grave a sin</i>
<i>as any, my lady.</i>

574
00:42:52,228 --> 00:42:53,962
Take her.

575
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,698
<i>No. Tommen.</i>

576
00:42:56,766 --> 00:42:58,500
Tommen!

577
00:42:59,735 --> 00:43:01,836
You can't do this.
I am the queen.

578
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,539
Tommen!
Tommen!

579
00:43:04,573 --> 00:43:07,075
<i>I am your queen.</i>
<i>How dare you?</i>

580
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:08,610
<i>Take your hands off me!</i>

581
00:43:08,678 --> 00:43:11,312
<i>Tommen!</i>

582
00:43:34,537 --> 00:43:36,705
What do you want?

583
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,574
Lord Ramsay sent me to draw you
a bath, my lady.

584
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:42,343
You want to be
clean and fresh

585
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:44,245
for your new husband,
don't you?

586
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,631
You're so beautiful,

587
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,701
but you need
to keep him happy.

588
00:44:06,736 --> 00:44:11,005
Ramsay gets
bored easily.

589
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,141
You don't want
to end up like--

590
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:17,746
well, like the others.

591
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,115
What others?

592
00:44:20,149 --> 00:44:22,417
I shouldn't gossip.

593
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:25,053
Oh, it's good to see
the red again.

594
00:44:25,087 --> 00:44:27,088
No point hiding anymore.

595
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,590
What others?

596
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,226
Let's see,
there was Kyra

597
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,228
the blacksmith's
daughter.

598
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,864
She was tall like you,
lovely figure.

599
00:44:35,898 --> 00:44:40,368
But she talked
and talked and talked

600
00:44:40,402 --> 00:44:43,772
and Ramsay grew
tired of that.

601
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,307
Then there was Violet.

602
00:44:46,342 --> 00:44:48,877
She had gorgeous
blonde hair.

603
00:44:48,911 --> 00:44:51,846
But she got pregnant.

604
00:44:51,881 --> 00:44:54,783
And, well,
that was boring.

605
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,486
Then Tansy.

606
00:44:58,521 --> 00:45:00,155
Such a sweet girl.

607
00:45:00,189 --> 00:45:05,393
Of course, sweet girls
get a bit dull

608
00:45:05,427 --> 00:45:07,495
after a while,
don't they?

609
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,831
Ramsay let me come
with him on that hunt.

610
00:45:09,865 --> 00:45:10,999
Hunt?

611
00:45:11,066 --> 00:45:12,867
Mmm.

612
00:45:14,937 --> 00:45:19,207
Have you ever seen
a body after the dogs have been at it?

613
00:45:19,275 --> 00:45:21,142
Not so pretty.

614
00:45:23,112 --> 00:45:26,281
But, well, it's your
wedding day.

615
00:45:26,315 --> 00:45:28,783
Why am I talking
about such things?

616
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,921
What was your name again?

617
00:45:32,955 --> 00:45:34,556
Myranda.

618
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:39,394
And how long have you
loved him, Myranda?

619
00:45:42,798 --> 00:45:45,934
Did you imagine that he would be
with you forever, is that it?

620
00:45:45,968 --> 00:45:48,136
And I came along
and ruined it.

621
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,776
I'm Sansa Stark
of Winterfell.

622
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:59,214
This is my home
and you can't frighten me.

623
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,822
Are you done with
your bath, my lady?

624
00:46:08,824 --> 00:46:10,758
Go. I can finish
on my own.

625
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,785
Yes?

626
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:49,831
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

627
00:46:54,403 --> 00:46:57,705
If you please, my lady,
will you take my arm?

628
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,241
No.

629
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:03,578
Lord Ramsay, he said
I'm to take your arm.

630
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,113
I'm not touching you.

631
00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:08,950
Please.

632
00:47:09,018 --> 00:47:10,952
He'll punish me.

633
00:47:12,821 --> 00:47:15,490
You think I care
what he does to you?

634
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:35,503
Who comes before
the old gods this night?

635
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:40,141
Sansa of the House Stark

636
00:48:40,175 --> 00:48:42,910
comes here
to be wed.

637
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:48,816
A woman grown,
trueborn and noble.

638
00:48:48,851 --> 00:48:53,287
She comes to beg
the blessings of the gods.

639
00:48:55,124 --> 00:48:57,225
Who comes to claim her?

640
00:49:06,168 --> 00:49:08,136
Ramsay of House Bolton.

641
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:11,773
<i>Heir to the Dreadfort</i>
<i>and Winterfell.</i>

642
00:49:14,276 --> 00:49:16,711
Who gives her?

643
00:49:18,981 --> 00:49:24,185
Theon of House Greyjoy,
who was--

644
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,158
who was her father's ward.

645
00:49:32,461 --> 00:49:35,997
Lady Sansa,
will you take this man?

646
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:07,595
I take this man.

647
00:50:39,094 --> 00:50:41,262
Are you pleased,
my lady?

648
00:50:44,032 --> 00:50:47,034
Good. I want you
to be happy.

649
00:50:57,246 --> 00:50:59,914
My father said
you're still a virgin.

650
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:08,189
- Uh, yes.
- Why?

651
00:51:11,894 --> 00:51:15,129
Why are you
still a virgin?

652
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,431
Afraid of dwarves?

653
00:51:18,967 --> 00:51:21,068
Lord-- Lord Tyrion
was kind.

654
00:51:21,103 --> 00:51:24,639
He was gentle.
He never touched me.

655
00:51:26,275 --> 00:51:27,642
You're not lying to me?

656
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,477
No, my lord.

657
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:32,246
Lying to your husband
on his wedding night,

658
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:35,783
that would be a bad way
to start a marriage.

659
00:51:40,689 --> 00:51:43,824
We're man and wife now.

660
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:45,927
We should be honest
with each other.

661
00:51:46,028 --> 00:51:47,762
Don't you think?

662
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,631
Yes.

663
00:52:00,642 --> 00:52:02,476
Good.

664
00:52:04,713 --> 00:52:06,581
Take off your clothes.

665
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:12,587
Oh, no, no, no.

666
00:52:12,654 --> 00:52:15,623
You stay here, Reek.

667
00:52:15,657 --> 00:52:17,925
You watch.

668
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:32,974
Do I need to ask
a second time?

669
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:35,243
I hate asking
a second time.

670
00:53:03,205 --> 00:53:04,405
Reek...

671
00:53:04,439 --> 00:53:07,642
I told you to watch.

672
00:53:13,382 --> 00:53:16,484
You've known Sansa
since she was a girl.

673
00:53:17,753 --> 00:53:19,587
Now watch her
become a woman.

674
00:54:07,402 --> 00:54:13,902

<font color=#FFFF00>♪ Music playing ends  ♪</font>

677
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,231
I believe this mission
to be reckless.

678
00:55:36,518 --> 00:55:38,386
And an insult to all
the brothers

679
00:55:38,413 --> 00:55:40,889
who have died,
fighting the wildlings.

680
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:42,922
You're losing
all your friends, Tarly.

681
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:47,565
We march to victory.

682
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:50,742
Or we march to defeat.

683
00:55:50,837 --> 00:55:52,239
But we go forward.

684
00:55:52,263 --> 00:55:54,528
My family still has friends
in the North.

685
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,131
I serve the Gods.

686
00:55:59,534 --> 00:56:01,803
The Gods demand justice.
